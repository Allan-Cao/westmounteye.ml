So there we are: November 30th. Many of us woke up later than usual, rolled out of bed, and plopped in front of a computer for the next six hours. Welcome to the next few weeks of our lives! We now live with the fact that we will be stuck in the same spot, in the same room, for the majority of our waking hours; staring at a screen with teachers watching our every move. Don’t get me wrong– in a way, it’s very nice that we’ve kept up a consistent schedule and seem to be more organized this time around. However, many have been finding that the transition has also left them unmotivated, behind schedule, and demoralized. 

This transition almost feels like a step back, like something we had already overcome but which is back to haunt us. Many are struggling to come to terms with our new situation, while others are simply enjoying the extra few minutes of sleep and comfort. Regardless, it’s important to note that online school will NOT be anything like it was last year. This year, our academic performance will continue to be assessed, so we need to keep on top of our schoolwork. “So what can I do?”, you may be asking. Well, a good place to start would be to read this article. We have compiled numerous tips and tricks to help you stay on track with both your academic and personal well-being.

### Staying in touch

#### How to stay in touch with teachers 

Back when we were at school, it was much easier to keep in touch with what was going on. If you didn’t understand something, you could simply go ask your teacher or a friend face to face. Unfortunately, now the best we can do is send our friends a DM  or email our teacher, both of which are unlikely to be seen immediately. 
It can be daunting to unmute yourself in front of your entire class, or to use the meet chat to ask a question that you feel you may be judged for. You may think you need to immediately understand what is going on and what you should be doing. THIS ISN’T THE CASE! I am personally asking you, for your own sake: to ask your teacher for help, to ask your teacher your questions, and to ask your teacher for extensions if you need them. It’s ok to be behind right now. It’s ok to not know how to start your work. It’s ok to ask for extra time to start that project,  due in three days. Teachers understand the situation we are in right now is painful, messy, and very, very stressful for all of their students, and they will do their best to try and help you. 

If you need help, but simply feel uncomfortable with asking your question in a dead-silent virtual classroom, that’s fine. An email would be a great way to communicate your questions/concerns/suggestions to your teacher. First off, if you don’t know your teacher’s email, visit https://www.westmountcharter.com/contact/ and locate their name. Remember, don’t stress over writing the email; it’s not a university application. Still, you’ve got to remember that you’re addressing a superior, so you need to ensure you maintain your respect. Have a clear subject line and start off with a kind, standard, or formal greeting. Be clear and get to the point. State why you are emailing them before elaborating on the topic. Once you’ve said your piece, add something before you sign off. Personally, I don’t think you can’t go wrong with a “Thank you” or “Kind Regards”. Aaaand there you go! A perfect email with a 95% chance of ever being replied to. 

#### How to stay in touch with friends

Friends are essential to your mental health, and can be your second family. They are hopefully the people you trust the most. If you’re feeling overwhelmed or upset, it can often help to talk to someone. Yes, you may feel like you’d be a burden, but good friends will never put you down for sharing how you feel. 

But how do you keep in touch with your friends in this new online environment? Well, first off, you need to identify which of your friends you need to keep in touch with. This may just include your best friends, or it could be everyone you’ve ever met. Next, and I can’t stress this enough, make sure to plan activities with your friends. It’s probably not the best idea to meet up with them given the current situation. However, that doesn’t mean you can’t do anything. Host a game night once a week on your dead Discord server. FaceTime your best friend and talk about what’s going on until you both fall asleep. Host a competition with your friends, with a prize of a free lunch once you all get out of quarantine. I personally find that once I’m with my friends, most of my cares and worries simply float away. It’s just me, their voices, and the game of Among Us I know I’m going to lose. 

### How to care for your well-being

#### Physical

It may not seem like it, but your physical well-being is an essential part of your day-to-day life. Physical exercise is vital to keep your bones and muscles strong. Personally, I believe that it’s fine  to gain weight in stressful situations and that your weight has nothing to do with your value as an individual, but I also recognize that gaining weight can be a difficult experience for many. Proper physical activity can be a great way to ensure you’re happy in your body, and can also mitigate anxiety and depression symptoms.

#### Mental

Where to begin? Your mental health is one of the most important things to watch out for in quarantine. If you have poor mental health, it becomes much easier for the rest of your life to fall apart as well. Do whatever you need to do to relax. Read a book. Play video games. Do a facemask and nourish your skin. A trick that I’ve learned is to wake up every day, believing the day has a purpose. Your purpose may be to complete a massive assignment you procrastinated, or it could be simply making it to tomorrow. Just remember: everything you do and don’t do has a purpose.

Something that I find gifted kids in particular struggle with is drawing the line. We don’t understand when enough is enough and we work ourselves until we get burnt out. This shouldn’t be the way we spend our carefree years. I encourage you to take a break whenever you feel you need to. I don’t mean that you should never work because you feel like you “always need a break”. Instead, plan your breaks in advance. Know that you’ll be burnt out after the math test, and preemptively give yourself the rest of the night off. Recognize you’ve spent weeks on your big assignment and give yourself a full day off. Learn to recognize when you actually need a break in order to spend time on yourself, because it is very easy to lose yourself in your duties and work when in quarantine. 

#### Social

I’ve already touched a bit on this topic, but there are a few extra things I need to add. Just as you should expect your friends to be there to support you, you also have to recognize that you need to be there for them. There are people who don’t understand this, and who have ruined many a friendship. Make sure you are there for those who are there for you! On top of that, make sure you aren’t acting in a toxic manner towards your friends. These are difficult and stressful times, and it would be awful if you made it worse for those you care about. Most of the time these actions are unintentional, so check with your friends and yourself to make sure you are being the best you that you can be.

I know this all seems boring. After all, you must have been told these things before by numerous others, but it’s because these things are true. You have to take care of your well-being because, being frank, no one else will. Do your best to stay healthy and things will look up. You just have to believe that they will.

### Staying calm & destressing 

Stay positive – sending out positive vibes makes it much easier for you to stay calm and get through the day-to-day tasks of life. 

Meditate – meditation has been proven to help reduce stress, while also relaxing the mind and body. To start, sit down for 5 minutes and focus on your breathing. When thoughts arise, simply accept their presence .

Exercise – whenever you are physically active, your body releases endorphins to boost your mood and destress your mind. It also helps you stay strong and healthy. 

Take a break – schedule time everyday, even if it's just for 10-15 minutes, in order to escape the world and do what you love. 

Find ways to destress – even the simplest things in life, like listening to music or taking a bath, can help you destress.
