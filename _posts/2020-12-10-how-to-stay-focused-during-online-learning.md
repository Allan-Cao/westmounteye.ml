Just because the pandemic is here does not mean that we can slack off of school. As the future backbone of society, we’re still expected to go to university (maybe), get a job, and make an impact on society. The world keeps turning, and we’re expected to be a part of that. However, we understand how hard it is to stay on task during online school, which is why we’ve prepared a list of 6 tips on how to stay focused while studying and learning online.

#### Tip 1: Find the right environment

Homework can be rough and tiring, and can often take a while to complete. This can be made much worse if you have to deal with environmental distractions. Whether it be your little brother running into your room and screaming at you, or your parents having a conversation in the background, these tiny irritants can as a whole make maintaining your concentration much harder. 

To prevent this, you should make sure that you are in a quiet, comfortable area, with few distractions. Studying in quiet, comfortable areas, where few people are, will drastically increase your productivity. It’s a simple concept really– compare studying in the heat of a party to studying in the middle of a library. And make sure to work in areas that won’t constantly distract you. For example, studying in front of a live TV likely will not help you learn effectively. Constantly exchanging glances between the TV and your textbook will lead to you learning very little. 

In addition to a good learning environment, you should also be studying with a proper setup. Make sure that you have a good chair that doesn’t hurt your back, and that you have enough room to work. Your lights and laptop should also be in serviceable conditions, and the latter should have the programs you need to attend lectures and do homework. On top of the basics, you could also choose to add amenities such as a textbook stand or headphones.

#### Tip 2: Lower your expectations 

Procrastination may be one of the most annoying forces in life. You don’t want to do what you need to get done, and you tell yourself, “Fine. 5 more minutes”. But the clock keeps on ticking and 20 minutes later, you’re still in the same position you were initially in. You’ve gotten no work done, and wasted an extra 15 minutes on top of it all. 

Well, here’s one way to destroy that habit. Break down your tasks into smaller chunks. Instead of telling yourself you’ll read the whole chapter of the textbook, tell yourself you’ll read a paragraph. After you’ve read the paragraph, you’ll likely find that it's easier for you to read the rest of the textbook. You can also divide your tasks by the day to decrease how many you have to tackle per day. It will make your days feel less overwhelming, less stressful, and easier to deal with– giving you more motivation to complete your tasks. 

If that doesn’t work, you can always just lower your expectations. Instead of saying that you’ll  do 2 hours of math every day, try saying you’ll do one. It’ll be easier on you – you’ll be more consistent, and as they say, consistency is key. Now you might be wondering: what do I do if I’m already studying, but I want to take a break and procrastinate? Simple answer: everytime you want to procrastinate and take a break, just tell yourself, “I’m going to have a break in a few minutes, so I should keep studying now. This leads me to my next tip: the pomodoro technique. 

### Tip 3: Use the pomodoro technique
    
For those of you who don’t know of the pomodoro technique, here’s my simple, (probably) extremely bad take on it. It's a technique where you work for 25 minutes, then take a 5 minute break. Usually, after 4 of these intervals, you get a longer break–between 20 to 30 minutes. 

At first, the pomodoro technique might seem useless, but it has been proven to increase productivity. It allows you to focus intensely for short periods of time, whilst also allowing you to take breaks to prevent burnout.  It makes your studying more bearable, making it so you only have to study on high focus for 25 minutes at a time. The technique also motivates you to study hard– every 25 minutes, you get a 5 minute break to do whatever you want. Over time, using the pomodoro technique will even train your subconscious to go into a “work” mode, making your efforts extra productive. 

Side note: You can try to implement the pomodoro technique during online classes as well. Of course, don’t apply it during a lecture. Instead, apply the technique when you’re given work time. Your efforts will be both more productive and far more bearable. 

#### Tip 4: Maintain interest swapping topics and incorporating games

Sometimes, after studying the same topic for a while, you begin getting bored, losing interest, and slacking off. You can prevent this by swapping your study topic before this occurs. Try it out. After 4 or so pomodoros of math or science, swap the topic and do a few pomodoros of humanities, for example. If you still find studying too boring, try to create games while studying in order to motivate yourself– but make sure that the games you make help you understand or memorize the information.

#### Tip 5: Social media is an enemy (yes, I know, unbelievable) 

Social media is one of those things in our lives that we just can’t seem to leave alone. One notification, and you’ll ditch everything you’re doing to respond– including your lecture notes and homework. 

Despite the distracting potential of these apps, no one wants to delete them just to study better, so we’re here to offer a compromise. Don’t get rid of the apps – just turn on do not disturb mode. Go into your settings, and temporarily disable your notifications. When you’re done studying, you can get back onto social media and browse through your feed. 

If you don’t want to turn on do not disturb mode, there are other ways for you to maintain your focus. For example, you could social distance yourself from your phone. Place it in another room where you can’t see or hear it. You could also download an app which blocks distracting programs, such as the following: Self-Control, Freedom, or Focus. Whatever it is that's distracting you, try to distance yourself from it. Limit your distractions so you can maintain your study flow state. 

#### Tip 6: Set proper goals for your studying

When we’re not learning in person,  we can often lose track of what we need to do. To combat this, set goals for yourself. Let yourself know what you want to achieve and create plans to get there. 

When studying, you should have two goals– a micro-goal and a macro-goal. A micro-goal is what you want to get out of a study session. Which concepts do you want to revise? Which concepts do you want to learn? How many questions will you do? Which types of questions will you do? These are all questions that can guide your micro goals. Macro-goals address the overall purpose of your studying. Are you studying to get into your desired major? Or are you studying to obtain your high school diploma? However, a macro-goal should never be to get a desired grade. These are study goals, meaning that they are goals related to your understanding of the content– not the side objectives. 

After you’ve set your goals, create a daily to-do list to remind you what to do. Check off the tasks you’ve finished and feel accomplished by the end of the day.
