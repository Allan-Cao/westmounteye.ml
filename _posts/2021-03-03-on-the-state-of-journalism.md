If you’ve been keeping up with recent school events, you may have heard that we’ve been on the news for less than…shall we say favourable reasons. And while I was displeased with the source of the issue, I’m far more irritated by the news story, and what it says about the state of journalism in the modern day.

For the uninitiated, 660 News ran a piece on a racist Instagram account with connections to Westmount Charter School.  The account was quickly terminated by administration and the affair dealt with appropriately, maturely, and swiftly. End of the story, right? Things like this, while unfortunately common, are hardly newsworthy, and given the extremely limited number of followers and engagement on the account, as seen in the video, it certainly seems that even if the purpose was to raise awareness during Black History Month, there would have been far better things to focus one’s attention on, like Black-owned businesses, or perhaps a short story on Amber Valley -- a notable and historically significant Black community in Alberta. And even if the desire was for some negative news, such a small account hardly seems like the most notable part of the racism issue to report on. But of course, these stories aren’t being actively pursued. Instead, one individual with slightly too much time and self-importance will call up the station, and voila -- a piping hot dose of nontroversy.

Barring the laziness of the story itself, it seems a similar amount of care was taken with the research for this story -- which is to say, almost none. From calling Westmount a “private” school, to using plural nouns despite contacting exactly one individual, one must wonder if this is the result of a complete and utter lack of care for the work performed, or an attempt to push some aimless agenda whose direction I couldn’t begin to unravel. Not a single primary source outside of the instigating account was contacted, despite plenty of opportunities through social media to request for interviews. Instead, they brought in an activist, who although well-meaning, provided little but vague platitudes combined with statements that would come across as slanderous if not for the fact she has no knowledge of anything that’s going on in this situation. However, the fact the outlet decided to broadcast these ill-informed sentiments is an insult to us as students, our school staff, and our community as a whole.

But once again, ill-informed seems to be the norm. Despite the fact the account claims our school attempts to include an excess of diversity, the reporting still implies we don’t offer enough support to our marginalized students while fostering white supremacy. No attempt was made to find any facet of the story that wasn’t convenient for the narrative presented to the outlet. Instead, they ran with what they had, and ignored the fact that perhaps it wasn’t the entire story. Finally, the story takes not only the Instagram feed of our school diversity council, a group not at all involved in the story, but also the faces of students to use as content, without requesting any form of permissions or even providing notification. Furthermore, it’s not even used to make a point, but merely to pad runtime. This clear lack of respect for the stories these outlets cover and the people they claim to support shows a complete inability to pursue anything other than runtime and clicks. Such is the cancerous growth of the 24-hour news cycle.

The worst part is the fact this isn’t an isolated instance. Social media has allowed for a self-perpetuating cycle between hate groups and the media, where outlets seek out information to justify a story rather than the other way round, while those desperate for attention or coverage need only to express as outlandish a view as possible to be instantly made famous, if only for 15 seconds. Regardless of likes or comments, one post on a social media is ultimately the same as any other, and so it allows news outlets to name and shame the worst takes on the internet, whether it be over something benign like opinions on bagel toppings or something truly heinous like hate crimes, and make it seem as if an unknown, but *obviously* quite concerning group of individuals are spoken for by this one isolated post. Meanwhile, individuals wanting the attention, whether to make a point or simply for clout, need only to write up whatever elaborate fancies strike their mind, and instantly they enter a lottery for notoriety. This focus on the fringes of social media isn’t simply a mild annoyance either. It’s driving us apart, making us think that those we disagree with are far more extreme in their views than in reality, and fostering echo chambers online. In short, the media is causing us to see the worst of sites like Twitter and the ilk, encouraging bad behaviour, and fostering hate through fear. Social media may not be the world, but the media certainly likes to pretend it is.

Just remember: the modern day cable news network is not the New York Times of the 70s. They care not for exposing truth, corruption, and evil. They care only about clicks, outrage, and making their readers feel enlightened and morally absolved. They will use movements when they are popular and slander them when they are not. Anything perpetual is perfect, regardless of how much suffering it causes. I’m not asking you to boycott 660, or any news networks. In fact, I’m not sure I have any type of call to action. And it’s certainly not to go flame anyone involved in the piece; they’re merely trying to get their next paycheque. I guess the only thing I have as advice is to be informed, be skeptical, and think for yourself. Don’t let these seemingly innocent societal ailments corrupt you into someone you don’t want to be. Stay safe.
