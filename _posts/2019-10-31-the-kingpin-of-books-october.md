*The Kingpin Of Books is here to bring you your monthly literature recommendations. Enjoy!*

It’s 3 AM, and you’ve only just completed the final chapter. Bleary-eyed, you wonder where the time went. “It was only 11 o’clock a couple chapters ago,” you murmur, as you shamefully burrow under the covers, math homework left unfinished. Welcome to the opium den: where we give you book suggestions so that you can stay up super late and feel like garbage the day after. 

First up on the docket we have the Red Rising trilogy. My social mark and I can both vouch for how addicting this series is, since it kept me up, homework unattended, till 2 in the morning for a solid week while I hammered out the series. The books follow a miner named Darrow, who works in the dangerous Martian mines extracting Helium-3. I’m not going to say much more than that because spoilers, but it gets much more interesting from there. If you’re into sci-fi, this series is definitely something worth taking a gander at, with the worldbuilding being stellar (pun intended) and the ensemble of characters being out of this world (Pun also intended)! Recommend for grades 7 and above. 

Up next, we have the Inheritance Cycle (better known by the first book, Eragon). This series is a powerhouse of fantasy, although it does lose a bit of steam by the end of the last book. The quartet is the tale of a boy named (who would’ve guessed) Eragon, who finds a dragon egg on a hunting trip. When the egg hatches, he gets sucked into a world he would’ve never thought to exist, full of elves, magic, and of course, dragons! If you’re into fantasy with a large amount of lore, then this is definitely up your alley, but it does have a good amount of action mixed in as well. Recommend for grades 5 and above.

To close us out, let’s go with a classic: 1984 by George Orwell. Before we get into the review, I’d just like to preface it by saying that this book isn’t for everyone, especially if you had to read it for school. If you find it enjoyable, I think you’d agree that the ending made you feel doubleplusungood with what happens to Winston. What happens to Winston, you ask? What does doubleplusungood mean? Read the book! If you love dystopias, then this book will get you right in the sweet spot. Recommended for grades 7 and up, but do read it before grade 10, since you might have to read it for humanities. 

That’s it for this edition! If you have any other books or series that you think deserve a spot in the “I didn’t finish my homework because of this” club, give us a shout! We’d love to hear what you have to say.
