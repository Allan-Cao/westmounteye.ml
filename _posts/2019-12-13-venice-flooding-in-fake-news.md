Venice, the city of canals, declared a state of emergency on November 14th after unprecedented flooding swept through the city. This flood was caused by a natural phenomenon known as acqua alta, related to the alternation of high and low tides, though this specific cycle brought abnormally high water levels. 

On November 12th acqua alta caused a peak flooding close to the record amount set in 1966. The mayor of Venice immediately proclaimed that climate change was the cause of the flooding in Venice. During this time, limited media coverage reported mainly on the facts about the flooding, generally ignoring the mayor's previous comment. It was only once a state of emergency was declared on the 14th that the wider media began to run stories on Venice. Instantly, the mayor’s prior comment began a firestorm on Twitter with everyone blaming climate change and using this event as evidence for whatever message they wished to push. Comparatively, the media were relatively tame, but they too, used this bold but baseless claim of climate change to spark outrage in millions of people, citing our collective “climate inaction”. A BBC meteorologist was one of the few to actually research the climate change claims, issuing a statement which read, "While we should try to avoid attributing a single event to climate change, the increased frequency of these exceptional tides is obviously a big concern." However, the rest of the media began to do what they are best at: twisting the story for their own ends.

Some climate crisis criers completely exaggerated the issue at hand. They didn’t look at the situation with any sort of critical thought. Rather, they spewed out blatant lies about the subject. Headlines run by these extreme leftists included comparisons of Venice to a “canary in a coal mine” for coastal cities worldwide (NBC News) and a “disturbing preview for coastal cities” (sciencealert.com). It’s obvious that these outlets didn’t know, or didn’t care about the difference between tidal flooding and bursting river banks. Even the rest of the media, albeit tamer, spoke in a way that made the situation seem like an apocalypse for anyone in the city. A flood of 1.8 meters sure sounds like the city is in the deep end of a pool. However, Venice is not actually built at sea level. Most of Venice is 1.1m to 1.4m above sea level, while the lowest part of the city, St. Mark’s Square, is still 0.64m above sea level. In addition, the flood level is measured at the peak which only lasts a few hours, after which the streets are empty and wet, similar to after rainfall.

Besides misrepresenting the situation, the media has also been engaging in selective photographing and recording of the flooding. The media portrayal of the flooding caused many people to cancel their hotels in panic when in reality the situation was much tamer. This not only hurts Venice’s reputation but also the businesses of locals. Our foreign correspondent Josephi Krakowski happened to be in Venice and witnessed the media engaging in the aforementioned activity. “I witnessed a France 24 reporter standing in the middle of the water even though there was dry land on both sides,” Josephi told us. “It’s almost like they were trying to make the flood look as bad as possible. A wider pan of the area would’ve shown flooding of similar depth to that of a kiddy pool!”

Only a few hours after the photo on the left was taken by Josephi, France24 published a story detailing the flooding in Venice. The reporter, Seema Gupta, spoke her script with the backdrop of the flooded St. Mark’s square. While the actual news report was factually accurate and beneficial, the juxtaposition of the camera shot is an incredibly misleading move by France24. The situation in Venice is a great example of how a recurring, regular situation gets twisted, into a false representation of the impact of climate change by the media. Critical thinking has never been more important when the media we learn to trust are so capable of deceiving us.
