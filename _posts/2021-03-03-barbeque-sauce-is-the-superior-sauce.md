Think about your day-to-day life. How many times a day do you eat something that requires a sauce of some sort? If you enjoy ribs, you will likely glaze barbeque sauce over it as it cooks. If you consume chicken nuggets/tenders, perhaps you will add barbeque sauce instead of ketchup. Barbeque sauce is simply far more useful than many other condiments often held in high regard. A study showed that 81% of the participants involved demonstrated a clear preference for barbeque sauce on their ribs, and around Â¼ of people that consume chicken show a preference for barbeque sauce. 

Aside from statistics, the applications of barbeque sauce far exceeds any other, and the sauce itself has a wide range of possible flavours. For some, they enjoy the sour tang, while others prefer that rich, sweet taste that overpowers your palate. Whatever you need, there are a variety of barbeque sauces that can fill that role. Furthermore, almost every food that you may consume with either mustard or ketchup may have said condiments replaced with BBQ sauce. Think about hot dogs; though it may seem odd, barbeque sauce would fit right in, if supplemented by either mustard or ketchup. 

In comparison to other sauces on the market, barbeque is simply on a higher tier of existence. Of course, this is all highly specific to a North American palate. Finally, though I would argue that barbeque sauce is the King of North American Sauce, there are also a few other sauces that are near its level of utility. Worcester, Dijon mustard, and honey mustard also all have a variety of flavours, as well as applications on many different foods. But ultimately, barbeque sauce always comes out on top.
