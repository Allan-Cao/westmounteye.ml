By this time you’ve undoubtedly heard of the widespread economic and social upheaval caused by the Wet'suwet'en solidarity protests, conducted in opposition to a new pipeline. Though these protesters claim to be in “solidarity with” and protesting on behalf of the Wet’suwet’en people'', they misrepresent the vast majority of the Wet’suwet’en views, while ignoring court injunctions against the protests. The impact of these protests, which have escalated to rail blockades, have forced CN Rail to suspend operations, lay off 450 workers, and be rendered unable to serve countless passengers and cargo items. As the protests begin to grow increasingly out of hand, the government of Canada must act to remove these protesters and uphold the rule of law. It is imperative that we end the belief that those acting in the name of “indigenous solidarity” are above Canadian law. 

Worse still, we have uncovered and will be exposing corruption and the dark side of indigenous activism in Canada, involving extremists that have gone so far into the left lane of the political spectrum they are colliding with oncoming traffic. When we peel back the layers and look into this Wet’suwet’en crisis we see groups of anarchists and indigenous strongmen taking advantage of the situation to advance their own agenda. Furthermore, this conspiracy has been allowed to fester and remain uncovered by the media because of their fear of any negative pushback whatsoever.

Let us discuss the anarchist network our investigative journalism has uncovered. Two groups, going by the names WarriorUp and North Shore, appear to be blogs distributing information on everything from building Molotov cocktails to sabotaging rails. These anarchists believe that Canada was built entirely upon stolen land, and that Reconciliation is but a distraction by the government to force them to behave. This flawed logic has led them to believe that “It is time to shut everything the \**** down.” This anarchist network appears to be quite literally calling the moves of the most radical elements of the Wet'suwet'en solidarity movement, almost as if, once again, indigenous people are being used as a pawn in the world of political ideology. Despite the fact that the Wet’suwet’en band council approved the pipeline, these radicals have put words in their mouth, and are putting their personal and political interests over the reputation of an entire indigenous nation. The real purpose behind these actions are to manifest their anti-capitalist and anti-governmental mindset.This is what happens when we discredit the rule of law.

Molly Wickham, the ringleader of the protesters and supposed spokesperson for the Gidimt’en clan of the Wet’suwet’en nation, is actually not entitled to speak on behalf of the Wet’suwet’en people. An investigation conducted by JLSreport.com, and independently verified by the authors, uncovered that Molly’s father is actually a Caucasian and on her mother’s side, she is part Stellat’en and Gitxsan, not Wet’suwet’en. According to Wet’suwet’en law, which is constantly touted by these protestors, Molly is considered to be adopted, and thus “may never speak on behalf of their clan or nation, nor may they hold title as a Hereditary Chief” according to knowledge holders of the Wet’suwet’en nation. In an even more damning video, released by the group which controls the Gidimt'en Yintah Access checkpoint on the way to the Unist'ot'en Camp, two Caucasian males are filmed, clearly pretending to be hereditary chiefs, in a ploy to trick the RCMP into allowing their supplies through. These protestors are shamelessly appropriating the Wet’suwet’en culture, and yet the mainstream media doesn’t talk about it. 

In conclusion, it is clear that anarchists have hijacked the indigenous rights movement in order to further their radical and potentially harmful ideology, with very little consideration of the opinions of the actual native communities they claim to defend. Furthermore, whenever native groups do decide to pursue industry in order to enrich their own communities, those very same activists will put words in the mouths of the very people they portray themselves as representing. As a people, we must make sure to not mistake those that preach anarchy to take over the voices of indigenous groups, and thus force their ideology upon us all as a First Nations issue.
