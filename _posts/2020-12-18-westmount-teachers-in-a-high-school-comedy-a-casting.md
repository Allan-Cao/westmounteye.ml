*\*\*DISCLAIMER: THIS IS JUST FOR FUN, IT DOESN’T REFLECT WHO THE TEACHERS ACUTALLY ARE, THESE TEACHERS ARE ALL AWESOME PEOPLE!*\*\*

#### Mr. Good

The Rule-Breaker: The one who doesn’t care about other people’s feelings and has never handed in a single assignment in his life - how is he still passing high school? No idea. He shows up some days, but most of the time nobody knows where he is. Nobody has ever met his parents… he has friends, but even they don’t know anything about his life. Sometimes you walk by his locker and it smells a bit like weed. Even the teachers don’t want to deal with him, though, since he’s got an attitude. 

#### Ms. Taylor

The Doodler: She loves to draw cartoon characters in class, though it seems like that’s all she does - you never see her working on homework, but sometimes you see her hand something in. She must be doing decently well in school, you suppose, but every time you talk to her she mentions another one of her drawings. You ask her if she wants to be an artist and she says no - so why does she spend so much time on her art?

#### Ms. Pinnock

The Badass: She’s too cool for school - always hanging out with friends, skipping class, and wearing the trendiest clothes. She does homework when she has to, but never cares to do more than the bare minimum. Tattoos and piercings are her way of expressing herself - but her parents have no idea about them. Most people are intimidated by her, but she’s secretly one of the friendliest girls in school.

#### Ms. Dyke

The Smarty Pants: She’s a bit terrifying… but only because she knows just about everything. She answers all the questions in class, and has never gotten a grade below a 95 in her life. Nice? Yes, but she’ll unintentionally make you feel stupid all the time for not knowing as much as she does. She’s the one who actually reads the textbook, even though nobody else does, and will study things that she won’t need to know until her third year of university.

#### Mr. Yae

The Chill Guy: He tries hard and does well, but doesn’t care much about grades or school in general. He gets a good grade and he’s glad, but he shrugs off bad grades like they’re no big deal. You wish you were as laid back as he was. He’s got a decent amount of extracurriculars, too, but nothing too over the top. 

#### Ms. McCartney 

The Note Taker: She’s always writing stuff down, in every single class. Sometimes, when nothing is happening, you can still catch her frantically scribbling words into her 4-subject notebook. Is she a nerd? Uncertain… she never speaks up in class or anything, but clearly cares at least a little about the subject matter.  On the other hand, she also spends practically every waking moment outside of school with her boyfriend - but “you don’t know him, he doesn’t go here.” 

#### Ms. Dunseith

The Grammar Geek: You could be having the best of times, but the second you say “me and \_\_\_\_” instead of “_____ and I,” she’s on your tail, telling you exactly when you use “me” compared to “I” in a sentence. Having her edit your essays is great, but also daunting as she changes every line and explains comma splicing and Oxford commas in depth with her comments. You can always find her with a nose in a book - even in class, she reads instead of paying any attention to what’s going on. 

#### Mr. Ouellet

The Math Enthusiast: You know the kid who just looks up random math concepts for “fun” and will somehow already know everything you’re learning about in physics? Yeah… he’s that kid. Sometimes you wonder if he even takes other classes at all. How are his English or Biology skills? Who knows, but if anyone can learn everything there is to know about quantum mechanics at the age of 15, it’s him.

#### Mr. Head

The Magician: Hard work? No need. This guy gets the best grades in school despite never working for it - it’s like magic or something. The only thing you ever see him putting effort into is track and field after school, but other than that everything comes naturally. He talks about how he wants to continue with his sports career, or maybe wants to get a business degree, or was it a pharmacist certification? Honestly, you don’t remember anymore, but he wanted to do _something_.

#### Ms. Miller

The Ray Of Sunshine: She’s never not smiling, to the point where you wonder if her face has permanently frozen that way. Not only is she always happy, though, she makes sure others are as well - she’s like a shark, but instead of smelling blood she can smell tears from a mile away, and always comes to cheer people up. She never complains about school, or her parents, or anything else… she’s almost inhuman with how satisfied she is.

#### Ms. Werle

The Artist: She’s got bullet journals, ten different-coloured highlighters, two worn out sketchbooks, and when you ask her for a pen she’s got 4 boxes of different types for you to choose from - and that’s just what she brings to school. What she has at home must be unfathomable. She’s the one who takes the gorgeous notes, with every line thoroughly thought out to become a work of art. Does she ever have time to study them? Absolutely not, but she doesn’t need to graduate from high school if she can make a career out of selling her notes, I suppose. 

#### Mr. Gagnon

The “Just Trying To Pass”: He really _really **really**_ wants to get out of school as fast as possible. Barely passing his classes, this kid is always asking you for answers to the assignment questions and asks about grade 7 math concepts after reaching 11th grade. It’s unclear as to whether he’s actually really smart but just finds it hard to work, or if he actually has no idea what’s going on. 

#### Ms. Khaja

The Goodie-Two-Shoes: Her decisions are completely black and white, and she’s not afraid to tell on you. You’re absolutely sure she’s never broken a rule in her entire life - not even so much as talking in class while the teacher’s speaking. If she catches you doing anything wrong whatsoever, she’s going straight to the principal. A Straight-A student, no doubt, with endless community service volunteer hours, who hopes to “make the world a better place, one tattletale at a time.”

#### Mr. Doyle

The Gamer: The back of the class is his happy place, with his face fixed on a computer screen and his mouse aggressively clicking away at the 7th boss of his favourite PC game. He doesn’t talk to anyone willingly, but when you ask him if he’s done the homework he always says yes, without fail, even though you’re pretty sure you’ve never seen him working - like, _ever_. 

#### Mr. Monaghan

The Debater: Every time you see him, you bolt. He raises his hand in class? Pray the teacher doesn’t see. It’s his turn for a student council speech? You feel sorry for yourself… Because this guy is all about politics - he will never fail to bring up a democrat-republican feud, and he somehow links any “creative” school project he does to communism (literally, how?). If you’ve got him in your social studies class, it’d be best to drop out as soon as possible, if only for your own sanity.
