Greta Thunberg has become a figurehead for climate change movements around the world. She is also is scaring youth with her alarmist views on climate issues into believing that they have no future and will die within the next 10 years. This blatant fear-mongering is morally wrong and cheapens legitimate climate dialogue. We as youth are led to believe by climate panic movements that we have inherited the doom and gloom of a broken planet and that our parents have failed us. However, the reality is the exact opposite! 

The world that we have actually inherited has less poverty, less disease, and less discrimination than any other generation. To deny the facts and to push the idea that we have inherited a crippled, injured planet is to deny all the progress our ancestors worked to create for us. The thousands of years of human knowledge that has been passed on to us makes us capable of solving all our issues, and a simple glance at our modern world and all its technology is a testament to our society’s success. 

To avert a “climate crisis”, Greta incorrectly assumes that we must drastically change our way of life, and adopt this new climate change religion, by changing our diet and getting rid of plane travel, instead of developing new technologies to deal with climate change. This is precisely something that a child would say. Does Greta not understand the phenomenal role business and new technologies have played in the global reduction of poverty? To give just one example, the Copenhagen Consensus Center asked 27 of the world’s top climate economists to examine policy options for responding to climate change. This analysis showed that the best investment is in green-energy R&D. For every dollar spent, $11 of climate damages would be avoided.

Greta Thunberg was named as the successor of Jesus Christ by a parish of the Church of Sweden. If you are asking for proof that climate change has become a new religion, I ask you to look no further. If these church officials reasonably believe that Thunberg is the successor to Jesus Christ, then would that not mean the end times are upon us? Would that not mean that her authority is divine? Food for thought. Furthermore, this climate change religion claims to be backed by concrete science and predictions, and yet when do we see their predictions with grave deadlines come true? Never! Modern climate doomsayers have predicted climate and environmental disasters since the 1960s, yet none of their apocalyptic predictions have come true.

A popular statistic touted by climate doomsayers is that 97% of all scientists believe that climate change is occurring. However, said statement is based on manipulation of the numerous papers surveyed from scientists. Authors of the original papers have also said that this statistic is a misrepresentation and characterize of their work. Why have so few sat down and considered that throughout the history of this movement, their leaders have been using fear to make sure that their radical policies get heard and passed? It has become increasingly difficult to separate the so-called “science” of the movement, from the political agendas of socialism embedded in their so-called “solutions”.

There is no climate warrior in Greta Thunberg. There is only a child being exploited for the political gain of others. Where are the voices of dissent? Who is speaking out against Greta Thunberg? Are you?
