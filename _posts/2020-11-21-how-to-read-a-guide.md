One of the most essential skills to succeed both academically and in the workplace is being able to effectively read. However, a shocking number of individuals simply have not developed the skills to quickly glean information from written material, particularly if prose is dense or filled with jargon. With that in mind, here are some tips from the editor regarding tips to read as well as the pros.

1. Track With A Finger: This elementary technique may seem juvenile, but simply keeping your attention on what you are reading can be an immensely helpful way to maintain your attention on the text instead of whatever thoughts may be wandering in your mind.

2. Repeat The Text In Your Head: Humans are often most exposed to speaking as their conduit to experiencing language. Converting the squigglies on the paper to audio can help you understand the nuances of a text, or when your interpretation of the text doesn’t actually make sense.

3. Read Ahead Of The Roadblocks: Sometimes you’ll get caught on a segment which you don’t understand, or doesn’t seem to make sense. Instead of trying to spend all your brainpower on trying to unpuzzle the segment, try reading ahead a bit. Especially in literary prose, authors may give the context to a statement after it has been made.

4. Read A Physical Copy: If you are able, obtain a physical copy to read from. The eye strain from screens can severely impact the experience of reading, and the simple tactile feeling of turning pages can help you keep your focus on the reading at hand.

5. Make A Reading Space: In order for maximum reading efficiency, one must be situated in a room that makes reading as easy as possible. One such setup could look as as follows: A bearskin rug to sit on, 5 lamps connected by fairy lights into a pentagram, and a bathtub nearby in case you want to read while submerged in a mix of your sweat and stale water.

6. Make Some Tea: It’s been scientifically proven [citation needed] that the act of making tea will make you a better reader. Case in point, the English Empire was one of the biggest in the world, and exported the written language and literature culture of the United Kingdom all over the world. You know what other cultural touchstone they exported? Tea. And what about the second most written language in the world, Chinese (including all of the dialects)? Lots of tea.

7. Read In A Foreign Language: Try reading a book in a language you don’t understand. You may not understand a word of what is written, but at least you’ll understand that it could always be worse!

8. Give Up: Sometimes, you just need to accept that you’re not actually going to finish Infinite Jest, or Ulysses. Give up, and go watch the Big Bang Theory instead.
