Have you noticed that many media sources that claim to be objective are actually misinformation networks? Have you noticed that people today are more polarized than they have been in decades? Have you noticed that people are trusting less and less in our fundamental academic and governmental institutions? Have you noticed that your political opposition is extremely misinformed on very basic issues?

We’re living in a very unique time. People will look back at this part of history and note the rise of technology and the internet as a pivotal point in the development of our civilization. But what if I told you that these developments were affecting the way that political discourse and influence happens? There’s a word for this phenomenon, but before I explain it all to you, let me tell you a story.

I’ve been interested in politics for a while, but a pivotal point in my interest was when stumbling into the politics side of YouTube at 13 years of age, being introduced to a man by the name of Ben Shapiro. Ben Shapiro is a right-wing (far right by Canadian standards) political commentator who has gained fame in recent years due to his videos where he DESTROYS the left with FACTS and LOGIC! I immediately took a liking to him because of his detached, confident speaking style and his ability to outdebate everyone he goes up against….. who are mostly college students instead of academics…….. and where he has the mic……….. and where the audience is antagonistic to anyone who challenges Ben. (I was 13 don’t blame me!)

I quickly found myself believing more and more far right and sometimes outright bigoted things, as a result of watching Ben as well as other creators who were recommended to me as I continued to watch him. I believed that poor people didn’t deserve assistance such as welfare or universal healthcare because it was their fault that they were poor; I believed that systemic racism no longer existed and that disproportionate police violence against people of color was solely a result of disproportionate violence that people of color commit; I believed that homosexuality was immoral, because gay people are worse at raising children than straight people are; and I believed that trans women weren’t women and vice versa, just to name a few of my former beliefs. All of these are factually incorrect (and I will leave links to resources which debunk everything claimed here), but they felt true to me at the time. 

These new commentators I would watch would talk with such conviction, and I had never heard any counter-arguments to anything they were saying because I was so young and new to politics. What ended up happening was I ended up unintentionally getting into trouble on account of my open expression of these false views, in addition to antagonizing several students as a result of this. I would engage in effectively what Umberto Eco would call “action for action’s sake,” where I would engage in political action that would purely agitate as opposed to political action which would have a meaningful impact on the world.

What is the most striking thing about this period of my life, however, was that it took me a month to be fully radicalized, and it took me a bit less than two years to be fully deradicalized. This deradicalization process was very gradual, and only happened due to long conversations I would have with a progressive friend of mine, who introduced me to the left side of YouTube. The majority of the deradicalization process took place separate from social interactions I had where I could be alone in an environment where having my mind changed didn’t come with any social detriments.

Why am I bringing this up? I am mentioning this story of mine because it is a manifestation of the unique political environment we as a society have been caught up in. The fact that someone could be so misinformed so easily about political issues is something relatively new in society. I mentioned earlier that there is a word for this phenomenon. That word is “post truth”.

Post-truth describes a convergence of many different effects that the online environment has had on political discourse, but broadly speaking the term refers to a state in which the objective truth of an issue is less influential than emotive appeals. I was not influenced by an ever-increasingly nuanced understanding of political issues based on peer-reviewed research; I was influenced by emotive rhetorical appeals which mimicked the aesthetic of being rational and factual, but not actually being either.

The concept of post-truth can be best understood as more of a “post-trust” problem, in that the condition of emotive appeals mattering more than objective truth can be considered as a by-product of the decreased amount of trust in our institutions, academics, politicians, and news organizations. The reason why emotive appeals matter more is because there is an increasing requirement for these parties to engage in rhetoric which allows them to gain trust. While there are some legitimate concerns to be had over the lowering of journalistic standards present in today’s society as well as the increased prevalence of lying in our governments (Donald Trump appears to be a striking example of this), this lack of trust also translates into areas where a lack of trust is unwarranted, this area being academic institutions and academic intellectuals. The vast majority of the knowledge we have as individuals isn’t acquired first hand. Rather, it is through the study of academics which disseminate this information which we get our knowledge from. As such, an absence of trust in these types of institutions not only has massive implications for the mechanisms by which we as individuals acquire knowledge, but is also dangerous in that it delegitimizes the objective standards such as the scientific method which are incredibly useful for finding out information about the world.

There are a number of causes for this phenomenon (some of which I have already alluded to), including the way in which new forms of digital communication and the attention economy work, the lowering of journalistic standards, the promotional culture embedded in consumer capitalism, and the increased prevalence of lies in professional political communication which goes back to the second Bush administration. 

This combination of causes and the effects resulting from them explain all of the problems with politics today which are unique to our time period, as well as everything that I laid out in the first paragraph of this article. Why are many news sources which claim to be objective actually misinformation networks? Because of a combination of the lowering of journalistic standards and the attempts to capture users’ attention through a promotional culture which heavily relies on exaggerated information to make money, which can open way to further misinformation as it becomes easier to disseminate it. Why are people more polarized today than they have been in decades? Because of algorithms which are structured more for engagement and profit than they are for dissemination of factual information, which results in ideological filtering, also known as echo chambers, and confirmation bias. Why are people trusting less and less in our fundamental academic and governmental institutions? Because of the increase in misinformation spread around, often by governmental institutions, which results in a lack of trust in our institutions. Why is your political opposition extremely misinformed on very basic issues? Well I can’t answer that because my answers would presuppose that you agreed with me that my opposition is extremely misinformed on basic issues. A better question to ask is “why are many people extremely misinformed on very basic issues?” And that’s because of emotive and rhetorical appeals taking precedence over factual appeals.

I’ve put some emphasis on the idea that emotional and rhetorical appeals have taken precedence over factual appeals. However, this should not be mistaken for me suggesting that these are inherently bad. I’ve used heavily rhetorical appeals within this article which serve only to further persuade you and catch your interest as opposed to serving to disseminate information to further educate you. For example, my first paragraph was to prime you into being “yes-minded”. The repetition of questions which most people would answer “yes” to some or all of them results in you being mentally oriented or primed into agreeing with the things that I was going to say later. In effect, that first paragraph was purely to improve my persuasion. You may have even noticed that my last question was off. People on all sides would have answered yes to this, even though I would have only agreed with some of them, so it wouldn’t make logical sense for me to even ask such a question. However, this question could be answered “yes” to by nearly everyone who read this article, which contributes into you being “yes-minded” and thus being further persuaded by the things I was going to say later. These rhetorical appeals are fine as long as you use them to further disseminate factual information. Every fact that I have brought up in this article I can justify using a citation. The rhetoric simply allows more people to be educated as it makes my already factually correct argument more persuasive.

All of the ideas I’ve outlined so far one can agree with regardless of their political leanings. I’ll say it, I come at this from a leftist perspective. This comes with certain biases of mine, such as that I perceive this post-truth condition as being particularly prevalent amongst the far right and some strands of the far left. However, anyone can agree with me about the broader point that I’m trying to make which is that politics today is dominated less by fact and more by emotion and rhetoric. The only disagreement would be where these conditions are most prevalent. I think that this is important to point out because there may be some partisan readers who would by default disagree with many of the aspects of post-truth theory as I am presenting them in part or in whole because I am presenting them from a left-leaning perspective.

How do we solve the post-truth problem? There have been a variety of proposed solutions to this problem, such as enhancing transparency of online news, promoting information and media literacy, and developing tools to empower journalists to tackle disinformation, among others. It is important to note that because this is a problem with many causes, there will likely have to be many solutions to this problem, as each of the causes need to be eliminated in some way to prevent the conditions of post-truth from arising. Simply “fact checking” like we already do won’t solve the problem, as the organizations which do the fact-checking suffer from the post-trust problems which causes the public to distrust them, and often undermine their purported task by being unable to prove deliberate statement of falsehood. The solutions I outlined already, when implemented together, seem like a good start to solving this problem.

As someone who is interested in politics and who has been harmed as a result of the condition of post-truth, I’ve started a small project, a YouTube channel, one of its goals which is to tackle misinformation. It’s got a few videos up so far, and I’m planning on uploading more, so if you’re interested in that consider checking my channel out. I’ll leave a link to it at the end of this article. A shameless advertisement? Yes. But this is relevant to the article. This channel is my attempt at doing my part in solving the post-truth problem. What I want at the end of the day is to live in a world where I don’t have to do this. It is exactly the lowering of journalistic standards by allowing citizens to engage in journalism which is one of the causal agents of the post-truth problem. In a sense, you might say that I am part of the citizen journalism which contributed to this problem. However, my main goal is to be effectively a communicator of information derived by academics. I believe that as a citizen, being relegated to such a role would result in me most likely doing more good than harm compared to other citizen journalists and towards political discourse more broadly. I’ve spent the past year reading academic literature on all sorts of issues in politics, and now I feel that I am educated enough to take on such a role. Ideally in the future, journalistic standards would raise to a point where it would be harmful to the public discourse for me as a citizen to engage in advocacy in the way that I am doing it, and I would instead have to get a more formal education on the issues I talk about in order to contribute positively to the public discourse. However, we are not at that point yet.

Almost everyone should want a world where political discourse is dominated by fact rather than fiction, where emotional and rhetorical appeals take a secondary role behind factual appeals, where our institutions reflect the values of honest reporting, and where at the end of the day, the primary political divide is not one of differing factual understandings, but one of differing values. We do not need to become luddites to achieve this world. What we need are simple, effective solutions which deal with the underlying causes of the post-truth condition our society is in. The first step to solving a problem is to acknowledge that it exists. We know the problems that pervade politics today. Now it’s our time to solve them.
