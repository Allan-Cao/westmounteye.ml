In light of recent events, people have been calling Westmount a school riddled with many, many problems. But we, as students of Westmount, completely disagree with this. Westmount is a thriving community, full of quirky people who make up some of Calgary’s brightest minds. In this article, we’ll be expounding on this idea by showing one of Westmount’s most active and growing communities: the Westmount Debate and Speech Society. 

As of writing this, the authors of this article have just finished participating in debate regionals. 6 out of the 10 teams sent from Westmount are now going to provincials; under the skillful leadership of Mr. Benarzi, our club has shown its adaptability and capability to provide results under pressure. This tight-knit and vibrant community is something that not only shows Westmount’s colours and commitment to excellence but also represents our wider community to other schools. As Westmount students, we are truly blessed to have such committed teachers who are ready to respond at a moment’s notice and are always willing to help their students out. It is through this continued support that our community is able to thrive in a way that is both productive and healthy. Our debate and speech society demonstrates the strength of Westmount’s foundations, as well as the perseverance of the people that our school consists of. We believe that our community will push through adversity and enter into the burning dawn of a new and reforged Westmount Charter School.
