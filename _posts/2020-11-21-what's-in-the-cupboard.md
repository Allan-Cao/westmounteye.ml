We’ve all been there: walking through the poster-covered doors at the front of the school, making our way to the closest set of stairs - the ones leading directly to the math hallway on the third floor - and gazing longingly at the cupboard under them. When we had just started out at the school, we looked for longer, talking about it to our friends . . . but we grew older and quickly came to accept that we’ll never know what’s down there. 

You’re not original if you’ve made the joke that it must be Harry Potter, unfortunately crouched and reading a book in there - seriously, it’s become so redundant that a response like that has come to mean you must have no creative thought. Some people say it’s bricked up, like the door in _Coraline_, but without the creepy Other Mother on the other side of it (although some people add that to the story as well). Some go as far as to say it might not even open, but anyone who has spent their time near the door would know that it moves in and out within the confined space of the lock if you shove it around enough. 

People continue to joke around - must be Narnia, or bigger on the inside like the TARDIS, maybe even a dungeon or catacomb facsimile. But let’s face it, the joking is just a way to cope with the unknown. 

But you don’t have to do that much longer - I’m here to tell you about what’s down there.

That is, if you really want to know. I’m not messing with you - I really do know what’s in that cupboard under the stairs. I’ve seen it, been inside it as a matter of fact. But are you sure you’re ready to know? The mystery must have intrigued you to madness at one point, and I can attest to the fact that having the mystery solved is not nearly as exciting as you would have hoped. 

Imagine a world where everyone knew what was down there - where I told you right here and now - so that the mystery ceased to exist. Kids would come to the school and ask “Woah, I wonder what’s down there - maybe Harry Potter!” (see, kids that age still think they’re original for that comment) and their curiosity would be immediately diminished by someone responding, rather seriously, with an “oh, the cupboard? Don’t get caught up in it, it’s just a _______.” Now, where’s the fun in that?

If you’re a high schooler reading this, you probably don’t care whether I tell you about the mystery or not, but remember when you were younger, and debated the topic with your friends? It was a conversation piece, a puzzle worthy of Mystery Inc, a spot in the school that people never see despite being there for seven years…

Do you see why it’s so important for this spot to remain a mystery? I could tell you what’s down there, but where would that conversation piece go if I did? Why get rid of that excitement and curiosity? If you’re in grade 12, I’ll tell you when we graduate, but if you’re not, well...you’re on your own with this one.
