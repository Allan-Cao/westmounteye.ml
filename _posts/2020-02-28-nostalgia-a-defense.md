If you’ve been consuming any sort of news or social media recently, you’ll know that we, as a society, seem to be done with nostalgia. There seems to be a common understanding that giving in to nostalgia is giving in to emotion, and that your rose-coloured glasses conceal the bad and leave only the good. This, in turn, would foster a society that only looks backwards to “fonder days”, to the detriment of progress and advancement. However, as much as those who are sick of the latest movie reboot or schlocky fashion trend will seek to decry nostalgia as a surrender to base instincts against the progress of the modern systems in which we live, and as much as they may be right, at least within the contexts of their social priorities, I do think it is important to use this opportunity to discuss why we see nostalgia as such a bad thing.

Before we can discuss nostalgia, we must first define it. In a general sense, nostalgia is a longing for an idealized version of the past; that is to say a version of the past not representative of reality. With this idea being laid out, one can see how dealing with fiction and treating it as reality can be concerning for some. However, with that being said, the core argument as to the dangers of nostalgia goes as follows. Humans have memories, and those memories are intrinsically tied to the emotions that relate to the memory. Because the human brain is elastic, and therefore is not a perfect copying machine, the memories get distorted over time. Thus, a combination of distorted memory and strong emotion leads to an idealized past.

The danger, of course, is that this nostalgia for the past prevents us from wanting to take steps forward, leading to cultural, technological, and societal stagnation, regression, and eventually collapse. Now all of the charges above are clearly overblown. Bad reboots and Buzzfeed quizzes do not the death of Western culture make. But it is fair to say that an over-fondness for the past does lead to a slowing down of progress, as everything reflective and past-based does. In other words, nostalgia and a feeling of pleasantness towards the past leads to less of a drive to create change. 

Of course, change is often good. It signifies progress, towards some type of objective that we as a community want to achieve, whether that goal be simple or complex, and whether that group be small or globe-spanning. But the speed at which modern life changes is breakneck, and for many it is already too fast. And yet, still, the modern technocratic, capitalistic, and liberal society of the Western world emphasizes development and change above all else. The modern embrace of nostalgia, I would argue, comes from a place of wanting to counter the unrelenting changes that occur in modern life, at a rate where most are simply unable to keep up with the changing world around them.

Though the modern world may be better than any time period before, with better “quality of life”, the complexity of life has gone up, and some things, like the ease of a higher-level educational degree, has gone down. Statistically, the present may be the best time to live, but it may not be the most ideal for the human condition, despite what those immediately dismissive of the past may say. Furthermore, by seeing the goodness in the lost past, we can bring back what made the past so good, regressing in a way but simultaneously improving the world around us. 

The counterargument to this is often that much of the nostalgia that one has is drummed up by groups to further certain interests. I disagree. Groups such as corporations and political parties have a far easier time serving us what we want, than using the energy they could use to build new ideas to resurrect zombies that nobody desires. They use nostalgia because we demand it. Modern life demands we always live in the present, but by doing so, we lose much of what inspires us, what drives us, and what defines us. Nostalgia is not just an appeal to the past, it is also a reflection of what we want in the future. Our perceptions of past, present, and future all influence one another, and to disregard one of them deprives us of its wisdom and joy. So reflect on the past, and allow it to polish your view of your present and future.
