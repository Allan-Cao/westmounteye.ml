Many are taught from their first breath that school is inherently good. However, we, the authors, reject this notion. Before we begin, it is important to state that this article is in no way a case against learning. Rather, it is about the myriad issues with the “educational” format of school. In this article, we will attempt to break the illusion that schools have a magical ability to put knowledge into your head. In reality, no matter where or how you try and gain knowledge, you must ultimately do the learning yourself. 

It is our belief that state-sponsored public education reflects a pessimistic view of human life, where self-interest in knowledge is insufficient to cause the general population to attempt to seek and obtain it. This harmful view sees the individual as lazy, stupid, and weak, if lacking a direction dictated by authority. In truth, self interest is sufficient for a population to have an ample number of educated individuals, as gaining and possessing knowledge is in the self interest of individuals. It is in one’s self interest to learn regardless of what others know, and thus to study reality.

Often we hear the term “self-learner” in a context that suggests the phenomenon of “self-learning” is rare. However, in reality we are all “self-learners.” In addition, we hear the term “study” used incorrectly far too often. If one chooses to focus: one is studying reality. Focus is a perpetual state of studying. Man will perish quickly if he does not study. In this sense, all individuals are “self-learners,” only requiring data to interpret and glean understanding from. 

Concerning the ethics of the modern-day system of “education,” we give much credit to Brian Caplan (author of The Case against Education) for his “signalling” model of education. According to Caplan, school is primarily a hoop-jumping process. Students convince future employers that they are proficient workers by achieving high grades, which correlate to high working proficiency. However, how many of us will in our lives actually put to use our understanding of Shakespeare, highly advanced mathematics, intricate understanding of chemical processes, or the physical structure of living cells? Given the lack of application or interest in these areas for most individuals, one should therefore not be forced to learn such things.
 
So what should one study with one’s finite time? Inherent in public education is the idea that the government is responsible for deciding the content of what every child should study. This overlooks not only the parent’s right to raise their own children, but also the child’s interests and desired knowledge. It also implies the state’s ownership over all children, and what . The objective of policy creation is to separate the individual from force, so happiness can be pursued. Happiness must be earned, and similarly education. Education cannot be done to you.

In an age with the internet, “formal education” is an extreme waste of time.In order to learn more effectively, we, the authors, encourage you to try learning services such as Coursera and MIT OpenCourseWare - both free resources. Learn something of interest and see how much faster you learn.  Ultimately, in this world we possess the ability to study to great effect, as long as we avoid the pitfalls of sloth.
