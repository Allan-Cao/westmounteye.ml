#### Trigger Warning: Gun Violence, School Shootings

![](/assets/gunprotest.png)

Since the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012, school shootings have become more prevalent and apparent in our society, with one happening almost daily for the past 2 years in North America. There have been 2 deaths from school shootings on the day I write this. An Arkansas teen (15, male) who did nothing but be at the wrong place at the wrong time was murdered by a shotgun made available to a peer through the failure of American gun control, screening and gun safety. Had the gun not been available, the child’s life could have easily been saved, yet the systemic injustices that appear in the United States and many other countries have yet to be solved.

When governments are asked why they continue to let gun owners go free without criticism and circumvention of tragedies such as these, they respond with a simple phrase: “Second Amendment rights”. It is time that an answer like this cannot stand and cannot be taken with but a grain of salt. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness can no longer peacefully coexist with these Second Amendment rights; how can we say we have the right to life if millions have died because of shootings and we’ve still done nothing to solve it?

South of the border, the United States of America decides to ignore this because it would be too hard for them to change their constitution into one that actively protects people in their homeland. We can then ask, why couldn’t they implement a higher taxation rate on firearms, or have a better regiment on weapons in general? I strongly believe in the narrative that taxation and financial incentives are a good way to deter people from doing things the government does not want them to do. Of course, this doesn’t always work, for example in the case of the rich finding this to simply be a fee instead of a fine. However, we can characterize that most gun owners are middle class or lower. They may feel unsafe in their current circumstances and they own it for protection. We can also characterize that it is the “bullied” children of these people who don’t lock up their firearms who then take them and shoot others as well as themselves. 

In America, youth often have free access to guns, either through parents or through 3rd party dealerships that simply care about money and not who they are selling to. This happens quite often with 18+ stores that fall into insolvency because of supply/demand in their sectors. They start selling to minors in order to continue to turn a profit in their respective industries. The same happens with shops that sell alcohol or different types of drug substances (that also happen to sometimes be addictive! Hello, vape companies targeting teens and getting them hooked on nicotine for life). We as a society must have a better grip on the services and products we give people access to, especially if it's apparent these people cannot handle what is being given.

The simple solution to this issue stands as introducing gun control laws that de-incentivise people from buying guns, either by having a deterrent such as heavy taxation, or a strict regimen of pre-requisites before you are even allowed to touch a gun, for example security clearances or required qualifications to prove you are of sound mind to be owning a firearm in the first place. These are highly needed solutions to stop the sheer amount of deaths currently occurring through the systems of abuse of legislature that people are allowed to do.

The death of the 15 year old Arkansas boy today could have been prevented, but instead we continue to turn a blind eye to a problem that has been plaguing our society longer than the coronavirus. We continue to ignore the circumstances of the United States, and we continue to avoid the conversation on gun control, school shootings and how the at least 2,500 school shootings after Sandy Hook could’ve been avoided, had the US government cared about the citizens enough to attempt a chance at reconciliation with the community. Our children are dying, and the blood is on our hands.
