_The secret to saying “I’m going to fail” in one, easy-to-follow article_

#### 1. Not studying (approved)

Studying is hard, and nobody likes doing hard things, so it’s totally acceptable not to study. In fact, research shows that 50%\[1] of Westmount students still get mediocre test grades whether they study or not, so why put in the extra effort? By not studying, you’ll open yourself up to the following benefits:

(a) Having more Netflix time 

(b) Getting more sleep 

(c) Shedding less tears over your work

(d) Having more scrolling time for Instagram, Reddit, etc.

These symptoms are similar to other approved Westmount study methods (see “studying the class before” for more information). It’s important to note that everyone is different, and your symptoms may also consist of prolonged crying during and after the test, a failing grade, and/or school dropout, but this is only in extreme cases and is very rare (only a 75%\[4] chance!). Don’t let these few drawbacks let you down, though—focus on the pros!

#### 2. Studying everything the night before (semi-approved)

Though not 100% recommended, you can study the night before if you feel you need to, but be sure that you do this exclusively the day before and no earlier, as this may result in “good study habits” which we would like to avoid. 

In this method, you begin studying after coming home and continue until you are either (a) too tired to keep going or (b) have gotten more than 5 questions wrong in a row, at which point you should convert to option 1 because it’s useless to keep going with this method. 

Learning and studying the night before will take away from a day of relaxation and back-of-the-mind anxiety, which is the \#1 downside reported by Westmount students who have attempted this strategy. On the plus side, it’s proven to increase overall student grades by at least 10%\[5], which really comes as a shock.  

#### 3. Doing a little every day (NOT approved)

Contrary to common belief, one of the most ineffective uses of your time would be to study over a period of a few days. Instead, research suggests this stunts binge-watching shows and can result in productivity instead of procrastination. As a student, your first priority should always be to find ways to make your school experience the most stressful it can be, so unfortunately this study habit goes against our school fundamentals. This method can actually cause many long term defects, including, but not limited to:

(a) Excellent grades

(b) Stable mental health

(c) Lowered cortisol levels 

(d) More day-to-day organization

Most Westmount students claim all these symptoms were present when trying this study method, so we advise you not to take the risk. If you insist on being a “good study habit” type, please refer to the “studying the night before” section of this article, as this will guide you on a more Westmount-approved study method. 

#### 4. Studying the class before (approved)

Second only to “Not studying,” this method is right for you if you respond well to an extreme increase in stress levels in a very short period of time. Studying the class before makes you a good Westmount student, as it means you are putting effort into your work in a reasonable amount of time. The following materials may be needed for this method:

(a) A friend or two to explain all concepts

(b) A work block in the class you plan to study in

(c) Desk space for your notes, textbook, laptop, and associated tears (tear jar recommended) 

(d) The “I’m screwed” attitude 

Please note that depending on the class you are studying for, more materials may be required. For Physics AP or Calculus, please also be sure to have:

(a) A calculator with batteries 

(b) A larger tear jar

If this method isn’t right for you, don’t worry! See “Not studying” for a plan that may work for you.

We hope you enjoyed this informative article, and we deeply encourage you to try all the approved study methods before finding what’s worst for you!
