Tegan and Sara, aka the gay Gallagher sisters, aka the only popular music act out of Calgary still going in the current day, have now dropped their ninth album, *Hey, I'm Just Like You*, which has once again, failed to land them any mainstream success. You might know this musical duo for such hits throughout their almost two-decade-long discography as: *Everything Is Awesome* from the LEGO Movie. And maybe two songs that you heard on the radio years ago, that share titles with hits such as a Chainsmokers song (*Closer*), and an Avril Lavigne song (*Boyfriend*), respectively. 

The duo has existed in the indie music space for basically their entire existence, constantly changing, from folk, to post-grunge, to alt-rock, to indie rock, to indie-pop, to synth-pop, to electro-pop, and now all of these at once. Yet they’ve never really found commercial success nor become a critical triumph, only really being “that band your favourite band likes”. Indeed, they’ve drawn recognition from the White Stripes, the Bleachers, Cyndi Lauper, Hayley Williams, and Chvrches. 

Both Tegan and Sara Quin are accomplished songwriters and good producers, but they’ve lacked an album that has really held together both well-crafted and meaningful lyrics together with production that was unique and memorable. Coming into this record, I didn’t expect the synth-pop driven songs of *Heartthrob*, instead expecting something more in line with the lyrically driven and emotionally compelling folk-rock material of the heavily underappreciated *The Con* (cries in “Pitchfork gave it a 6.6”). This had me expecting the album to be musically good. Instead, it felt like a good golf game: sub-par.

The album itself, then. It’s positioning itself as a trip down memory lane, with accompanying memoir (Now Available For Purchase!) and songs with lyrics pulled right from cassette tapes made when the duo was still in High School (wow it’s the name of the book). And boy, do these lyrics sound like they were written between the ages of 14 and 18. There is, of course, a reason why most people don’t view the songwriting skills of teenagers as the creme de la creme of prose and metaphor, as teens are notoriously angsty, melodramatic, overwrought, excessive, unnecessary, and florid with their writing.

The lyrics in *Hey, I'm Just Like You* are cheesy, repetitive, simplistic, angsty, and sometimes just dumb. In fact, I can almost hear the ghosts of all of my own songs, written years ago, screeching their “deep meanings” at me. But many an album with poor writing has been saved by good vocals and production. I mean, just look at death metal music, where nobody knows what those large angry men are shouting about. And I still find a way to enjoy that. So let’s take a look at the aural component of this album, and dive into the songs themselves. 

The first song, *Hold My Breath Until I Die*, begins this album, as well as its continuation of the age-old tradition in indie music of using sentence fragments as song titles. It’s a solid enough bit of indie rock with a touch of synth-pop layered on top, despite the lyrics being very angsty. And before we continue, my comments on this album being subpar is a bit overgeneralized. Some of the songs are really solid. Unfortunately, there are just as many, if not more, songs that hold my attention as well as a piece of Swiss cheese holds your morning coffee. 

The second song, title track, and second single off the album, *Hey I’m Just Like You*, is probably the most solid song on this album. It’s a microcosm of what I expected this album to be, with an interesting contrast between the synth-pop and the indie rock aesthetics that grooves and captures the feeling of being two sad people happy together. The lyrics are also much more mature and are at worst interesting. 

The third track, and lead single, *I’ll Be Back Someday*, is the opposite of this. It’s pure punk-pop inspired, but insipid might be a better word. It’s too slow and lethargic to have any of that pop-punk rebellion energy, and the lyrics simply grate on my nerves. Repetition doesn’t help when one has to listen to an album several times, but I’d made up my mind about my dislike for this song from first listen. This song is a microcosm for everything bad with this record: it tries to be young and cut deep, but instead sounds far too self-indulgent.

The fourth track,  *Don’t Believe The Things They Tell You (They Lie)*, sounds much more indie-pop and chills out a bit from the last track, but in a good way. The lyrics are angsty, but not overly so, and the production hits hard, building up to with a wicked drop and some interesting guitar work. *Hello, I’m Right Here* is even slower, with stripped-down instrumentals and adequate lyrics. It’s perfectly acceptable as a soundtrack to sitting on your bed, brooding about various whatnots.

*I Don’t Owe You Anything* has a strange and clashing mix of production ideas that are way too busy, lyrics that say less than Gordon Freeman, and singing that’s drowned out and sounds far too dispassionate. *I Know I’m Not The Only One* is a boring indie rock song that sounds ahead of its time in the worst way possible, in that it sounds like it ripped off the present day. *Please Help Me* is a boring guitar ballad with honestly some of the worst lyrics on this album. *Keep Them Close ‘Cause They Will \*\*\*\* You Too* is a boring synth-pop song with honestly some of the worst lyrics on this \*\*\*\*\*\*\* album.

You may notice that I just went through five songs in one paragraph. That’s because there’s just not much to say about the middle of the album. It’s all just very subpar, as one would expect from a teenage songwriter’s debut album. So no real surprise here. *We Don’t Have Fun When We’re Together Anymore* at least has lyrics that are not overtly obnoxious and a decent indie-pop instrumental groove to it that makes it a welcome reprieve from the "Boring Musical Ideas Of The 90s" collection. *You Go Away and I Don’t Mind* is some indie rock that’s more energetic than *I’ll Be Back Someday*, and that sounds less whiny than *Please Help Me*, making it one of the best songs on the album. Somehow. 

The last song, *All I Have To Give The World Is Me*, concludes the album with a boring synth-pop beat, singing that sounds apathetic, and lyrics that read like an apology for the album. Yes, Tegan and Sara, you should have been you on this album, not the weird teen funhouse mirrors of yourself. Yes, you should have chosen the half of yourself that plays with innovative ideas and lyrics instead of boring cliches. Yes, you should have figured out that maybe you’ve grown tremendously as artists, and shouldn’t be turning old cassettes into a studio album. Now a mixtape? Sure, whatever, people have done much weirder on those.

It may sound like I hate this album or the artists for making this album. I really don’t. I love Tegan and Sara’s music, but unfortunately, this album is a step back, both in time and in quality. Hopefully, now that they’ve addressed their origins in full, their future music will be able to look forward even more boldly than before. And as for you the listener? Stick to the first five tracks, except for three, I guess. ~~Or just listen to The Con because it’s really good please just do it~~ But hey, what do I know. This is IndieSoda, peace out.
