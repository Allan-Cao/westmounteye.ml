Everyone knows the fact that the moon goes through phases. The real question is, _why_ does the moon have phases? Well, I’m here to answer that question!

Firstly, everything you’ve ever been told is a lie. The **government** wants you to think the moon is made of rocks and stuff, but everyone really knows the moon is made of cheese. Anyone who says otherwise is a total shill - I mean come on, just look at the thing! It’s definitely a fresh mozzarella, with a bit of texture from the gradual aging process. But that begs the question - how did the cheese get up there?

The answer brings us to one of the fundamental mysteries of Westmount: Why are the science teachers absent so often? They’ll tell you that it’s because of illness or children, but it’s actually a struggle for control of the night sky. You see, Mr. Yae actually uses the moon as a spread for his breakfast every morning. These trips often take a significant period of time, and that’s why he’s absent so often. He has no moderation whatsoever when it comes to said cheese, and when he feels especially hungry, he can take whole chunks out of what we ‘see’ as the moon. This explains why the moon appears to ‘wane’ after it’s full. It’s really just Mr. Yae hankering for some good moon spread. But how does the moon come back? What makes it ‘wax,’ as the so-called ‘scientists’ say?

It’s the physics teachers. Let me explain. Have you ever wondered why so many Physics 20 teachers make their students build trebuchets? Or what about all the egg drop tests you did in mid-school? That’s how they replenish the moon cheese. Every month, they spend 2 weeks bombarding the moon with cheese to satiate Mr. Yae’s enormous appetite. Ever wonder why Mr. Head does all his shopping trips? It’s to buy the cheese. That explains why the science teachers are absent so often - they have to rebuild the moon.

Now that you know the truth, I hope that you’ll stop spewing the propaganda that the government told you. Now that you know the real science behind the phases of the moon, I hope that you too can one day be as ravenous as Mr. Yae, and eat some delicious moon cheese.
