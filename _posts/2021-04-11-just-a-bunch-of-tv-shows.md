Being in quarantine sucks. The outside seems so much more welcoming — even if you don’t usually leave your house anyways — and when all your friends and family are out, it seems like things can’t get any better. 

So we cope with Netflix: sitcoms, romcoms, drama, thriller, we watch it all. Seeing people live somewhat-normal lives while we feel stuck in an endless cycle of isolation makes us sad, but if the show is good enough it can distract us from all of...well, everything.

If you’re in high school, you’ve most likely watched tons of shows on Netflix, Amazon Prime, Crave, Disney +, or illegally, and claim you’ve “seen everything.” Lucky for you, though, there are still tons of things out there for you to watch. 

In this article, I’ll be listing some shows you might have yet to see for your next quarantine “adventure.”

Note: Some of the Crave/Netflix/Prime shows can also be found in the Disney+ “STAR” section, so make sure you check that out if you don’t have the other streaming services but have Disney+!

#### 1. The things everyone watches, but you might have missed

a) Friends (Crave): C’mon, it’s one of the most popular shows to ever exist. If you haven’t seen it yet, just watch it for common courtesy at this point.

b) The Office (Netflix): One of the main reasons you probably haven’t watched The Office all the way through is because you watched the first episode and it bored you, so a word of advice: the whole first season sucks, skip it and it gets way better.

c) How I Met Your Mother (Netflix): You gotta congratulate this show on it’s consistency, with every season being just as good as the last. Sadly, the ending is total garbage, but everything before it is sure to entertain you.

d) Brooklyn Nine-Nine (Netflix): There’s no way you haven’t heard of this one. Adding the unique twist of being a sitcom situated at the police department, this show has been able to do some unique things with their storylines that other sitcoms can’t. It’s also much more recent, with the last season yet to come out.

e) New Girl (Netflix): One again, a newer sitcom for those of you who prefer references that they can actually understand. This show is also excellent all the way through, and even has a crossover episode with Brooklyn Nine-Nine.

f) Community (Netflix): This show is probably as quirky as it gets. Being both super meta and super random, Community is very unique in terms of episode and comedy style. A lot of our teachers are obsessed with it too, so if you want to be on their good side, try this out. 

g) Parks and Recreation (Netflix): Never heard a complaint about this show before, except that it’s a lot like The Office — but that’s not a bad thing at all.

h) Gossip Girls (Netflix): To be honest, I haven’t seen this one myself, but I hear people talking about how good it is all the time, so give it a shot if you’re into drama!

i) The Good Place (Netflix): If you’re looking for cool plots that you don’t often see mixed with comedy, The Good Place is an awesome choice. This show will have you going through an existential crisis, but still laughing your way through it. 

j) Stranger Things (Netflix): Despite what some people say, this show is not horror or thriller based — it’s just scifi. So if fear is what’s stopping you from watching, I’d suggest you watch past the first episode. Other than that, this show hits you with all the emotions, so be prepared!

#### 2. The ones you’ve heard a lot about, but probably haven’t watched

a) Gilmore Girls (Netflix): If you’re procrastinating on homework, try watching this — it might actually motivate you to see Rory accomplishing so much. Even if you’re not procrastinating, though, this show is something chill you can put on in the background, or watch when you’re not in the mood for sitcoms or intense drama.

b) Superstore (Netflix): It’s a new show, with its last season being released at this very moment. Like all sitcoms, it comes with a diverse range of characters and keeps you entertained the whole way through.

c) Modern Family (Netflix): This show comes with mixed emotions, as some say it’s aggressively average and others claim it's fantastic, but it would be wise to give it a try yourself first. 

d) WandaVision (Disney +): Looking for something short and weird? WandaVision is the least marvel-like marvel thing out there, as the superheroes appear to be trapped in, and playing along with, a television show. Making their way through decades of sitcoms, this six-hour weird-fest is sure to keep you guessing.

e) Prison Break (Netflix): Looking for something less sitcom-y? Something a little more intense and action-packed? Prison Break comes with an intricately thought-out plot and scenes that make you want to curl up into a ball. The twists and turns will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time.

f) Good Girls (Netflix): Want something more crime? Good girls is a great choice if you’re interested in this genre. It’s modern, funny, and entertaining!

g) Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Crave): If you’re more into supernatural-type shows, Buffy is the way to go. With great plots and monsters with interesting lore behind them, this show is great for anyone who can appreciate a little horror with their drama.

h) Suits (Netflix): This legal drama show is beloved by everyone who has had the pleasure to watch it. As a 9-season show with each episode being around 40 minutes long, it’s also sure to keep you busy for at least a little while.

i) Sherlock (Netflix): Looking for some trippy detective work? This brilliant show puts you in the mind of a master detective and “high-functioning sociopath.” It really stretches your brain, and of course has some great humour thrown in here and there. 

#### 3. The ones you probably started but didn’t finish

Some shows are just too long, or just get too bad to keep watching after the halfway point. But hey, if you’re desperate, you can try these out:

a) Supernatural (Prime): Some good plots, some bad plots, this show goes on for way too long but redeems itself at numerous steps along the way. It’s got some pretty cool episodes, like being stuck in a television or a scooby-doo crossover, and will definitely keep you busy for a long time.

b) Grey’s Anatomy (Netflix): It’s a soap opera, so there’s not much to expect here. Nonetheless, the show has some really heart-wrenching moments, and characters you learn to love. Most people stop watching halfway through because it’s 16 seasons of chaos, but if you’re bored what’s there to lose?

c) Pretty Little Liars (Netflix): A normal length for a TV show, but halfway through it starts becoming kinda repetitive, and the ending is just plain bad. Still, people like it for a reason, so if you stopped watching or haven’t watched it yet, you could try.

d) The Walking Dead (Netflix): The first couple of seasons are fun, and during the pandemic might hit closer than you’d like. Early on, however, the quality definitely drops, but people still love it and find entertainment in this long show. Give it a try!

#### 4. The ones you’ve seen on around, but just ignored

Just like you, I’ve also ignored these shows, but people who have seen them say they’re fantastic, so check them out!


a) Ginny and Georgia (Netflix): Some people find it weird and don’t like it, and others are obsessed.

b) The 100 (Netflix): People claim that either the writing is awful and it’s not worth it, or that it’s amazing and made them cry.

c) On My Block (Netflix): Apparently extremely funny, but also deals with real-world problems unlike anything else.

d) Bridgerton (Netflix): Amazing, but unfortunately very short. Still, definitely give this one a try!

e) Peaky Blinders (Netflix): Some more drama, equipped with great characters and a strong plot. Overall, seems like a good choice.

These are just a fraction of the great shows out there, so even after you’ve seen all of these, there’s still tons of options. But for now, this should keep you busy, for at least a little while.
