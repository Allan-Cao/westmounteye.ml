INTERVIEWER: First of all, congratulations on your victory. But, before we start, I think our readers would like to know a little bit about you! Mind giving us a brief introduction?

PARTHIV: Sure. I’m a Grade 12 student at your school. You might see me participating in different clubs, like Model UN or INTERACT, or you might just see me walking as one of the tall people in the hallways.

INTERVIEWER: So, let’s get right into it then. What are your big plans for Student Council this year?

PARTHIV: One of the things I wanted to address was the issue with lockers; coming into the winter people are going to be wearing coats and boots, and we don’t want to be carrying things like that around all day. One of the other things I also wanted to improve was the communication between Student Council and Admin, because in previous years it has been quite low, and slow. And I want students in our school this year to feel like they can still have fun, and still enjoy this year regardless of the current restrictions and situation going around with Covid-19, so we’re going to try our best to plan events that respect those restrictions but that students can still have fun at. 

INTERVIEWER: In that case, what specifically can the school expect to see in terms of events and such?

PARTHIV: There are a lot of different ideas going around, and we’re going to looking to you, the students and student body, for more ideas going into the year, but we can expect things like more communication throughout the whole student body, with events such as a drive-in movie, potentially, and different events that we will look into more and consider the efficacy of throughout the year.

INTERVIEWER: Like every president before you, you’ve said that you want to make meaningful change to this school. How do you plan on leaving your mark here?

PARTHIV: Oh man. Well, I know one of the things that I was going to try to do better than previous years, is create a solid platform for future years of Student Councils to work off of; something foundational, like a base or framework that they can look at to understand where they can go off of in future years, or where to begin, because I know that looking at Student Council this year, we kind of hit the ground running, and especially since our elections were at the beginning of the school year and we took a few weeks to start setting up our meetings as well, we weren’t really sure where to look. We had to look at a lot of different places to begin, so helping out future years and guiding them, or even as alumni guiding them in Student Council and just creating a foundation for future years.

INTERVIEWER: Let’s address a perennial concern then. What do you plan on doing about the school washrooms?

PARTHIV: For sure. So, we’ve been advocating to Admin, even since last year, about washrooms. I know there’s a lot of different problems, including faulty locks and faulty flushing. There’s going to be no change in that; we’re obviously going to be still advocating. Since there is less of a focus on events and public interactions this year, we’re going to be pushing that more strongly in our agenda this year to improve the school as a whole.

INTERVIEWER: There’s also been gripes with the process for getting events and projects approved. How do you plan on remedying that? 

PARTHIV: I think one thing, as I’ve mentioned before, is definitely increasing our communication with Admin. I think once we develop strong and consistent relationships with them, they’re going to be more willing to entertain some more decisions. And as well, I know this happened a few times last year in our advisory meetings with Admin, but bringing in some actual students who are not part of any of the councils or Grade Rep team members and letting them voice some concerns themselves; I feel like this can have more of an impact 	when you hear the voice directly from the student. Even though a representative’s voice is good, sometimes it is nice to hear it directly from the person with the concern.

INTERVIEWER: Adding on to that, you talked about how you want to expand the student body’s voice. How do you plan on doing that, and what are some ideas you have?

PARTHIV: As we know already, there are currently vacant positions open for Grade Reps, and Grade Reps have always been one of the best ways to get the voice of the student body up to council and up to Admin. I think that we could help the realize their role a bit better this year; we can encourage them to bring people from their grade to our meetings if they have concerns. This is essentially the role of the Grade Reps; to get the voice of the student body to Council. Even though council members can actively participate in this themselves, this is more so the role of the grades reps, and I think just encouraging them to do this more and guiding them, and listening to the student body. And especially, one more method we wanted to look into was social media; revamping the whole student council Instagram page, and we already have the new announcements page. Social media is just a really easy way for students to get their concerns in.

INTERVIEWER: Student Council has always had an air of elitism, or at least is perceived to be so by some of the student body. How do you plan on diminishing this, and make Student Council feel more open?

PARTHIV: I can see where this comes from. Oftentimes you hear things like “people are only doing this for the resume” or “the top tier only get in”. But, as we can already see, within our council we have a lot of diversity. Especially with these open positions that we have, and each of the future ones when we have future elections, our positions are always open to anyone on the student body. Once again, you are selected by the student body as a whole, but to reduce the feeling of elitism, we can also increase the connection between different grades, so it’s not just that the Grade 12s are running everything. We talk to the Grade 5s, we give them chances to share their opinions, we give them chances to contribute ideas, and develop their ideas too.

INTERVIEWER: Let’s get into the personal then. How did you fare during the pandemic? Pick up any new interests?

PARTHIV: Yeah. The pandemic was an interesting time for me at first. The first few months I was just focusing on school; I wasn’t really going out, just staying at home, social distancing. Over time, I picked up new hobbies, such as mountain biking, which became one of my favourite hobbies during the quarantine. And one other thing, I did participate in a health research program this summer called HIRES, and that was a really enriching experience.

INTERVIEWER: And just to quickly go back, how do you plan for Student Council to adapt to the pandemic circumstances?

PARTHIV: Already, we have noticed that our meetings are likely going to be held online, to also take into account the people that are learning from home and representing council as well, so that is obviously one of the things we are going to be doing. I believe all the other meetings that we will be holding will also be online, like the advisory meetings. We’ve also created a central communication platform for all members of council, junior and senior, as well as Grade Reps, Staff, and Admin. This way, even though some people are at home and some are at school, they can easily communicate with each other. We will be Discord to do so, and it has already proven to be pretty successful.

INTERVIEWER: And what about the effects of the pandemic on the student body?

PARTHIV: As a student body, if you are attending school in person, I’d say it feels pretty normal to be back. I think something I noticed personally was a change in habits, and I think looking almost two months now into the school year, we’ve almost gotten used to all these habits, such as sanitizing our hands whenever we get in, waiting for desks to dry, wiping off the desks with the sanitizer sprayed on to them, and the hallway directions; those are being followed surprisingly well, at least looking this far into the year. It was just honestly getting used to these new habits, but I think everyone overall, at least those that came to school in person, were happy to be back.

INTERVIEWER: That’s all I have for Student Council. Let’s get to know you some more. First, what do you do outside of school?

PARTHIV: I have a few different things going on right now. I participate in FIRST Robotics; I also am part of a group called Operation Med School Calgary, who help plan conferences for high school students interested in the medical field and surrounding fields. And I haven’t gone to this in a while, but I have spent some time volunteering at a physiotherapy clinic.

INTERVIEWER: What do you do in your free time?

PARTHIV: In my free time lately, which I’ve been having very little of; if you had asked me during quarantine, I would be saying things like “I played video games”. I did play a lot of things like Valorant during my quarantine, but also I spent some time mountain biking, which is one of my hobbies, and also playing bass guitar.

INTERVIEWER: Who’s your greatest inspiration?

PARTHIV: This is a tough one. I’m a strong believer that overcoming failure is what develops you as a person quite a bit, and a person that people often overlook who has gone though a lot of failures in the past is Elon Musk. Now the general things that people talk about are his successes when discussing him as a role model, but I respect him for all his failures and everything that he’s gone through, and still managed to succeed after.

INTERVIEWER: What are you planning to do after you graduate?

PARTHIV: After I graduate high school I’m looking into entering a program such as Health Sciences, looking specifically towards Ontario for that. Even further in the future I have hopes to get into the medical field.

INTERVIEWER: Favourite ice cream flavour?

PARTHIV: Anything with caramel in it.

INTERVIEWER: And favourite pizza?

PARTHIV: Meat-lovers.

INTERVIEWER: Anything else you want to tell our audience?

PARTHIV: I would just like to say I’m glad to be your president; thank you for voting for me, and I hope that we can all make the most of this year. 

INTERVIEWER: Finally, where can our readers catch you?

PARTHIV: They can reach out to me on my Instagram, @parthiv.m, or, when we revamp the Student Council Instagram, which we will be announcing once it is set up again.

INTERVEWER: Well, thank you for the interview, and good luck as President!

PARTHIV: Thank you for having me!
