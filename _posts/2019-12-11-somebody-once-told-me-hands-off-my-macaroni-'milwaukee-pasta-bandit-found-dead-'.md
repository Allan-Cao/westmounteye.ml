According to eyewitnesses, “He was looking kinda glum with his finger and his thumb raising up, pointed straight at his forehead.” Others reported, “Well, the witness starts calling and the cops start coming, they lay down the rules and the suspect starts runnin.”

The suspect allegedly said, “Didn't make sense not to live to run!” as he attempted to escape from the police. Unfortunately for him, according to the official police report, “His brain got shot but the pasta was done.” In fact, the pasta was recovered completely intact, with not a bite taken out of it. This is a real coup for the police, as pasta theft has become rampant over the past few years. It’s very difficult nowadays to go out with a casserole and not be harassed by marauders that wish to apprehend your noodles, so the fact that there is one less spaghetti swiper on the streets of Milwaukee is progress.

Official Police reports have acknowledged the problem, with one claiming there was “...so much to do, so much to see, all while chasing bandits in the back street.” Budget cuts in recent years have left police forces across North America scrambling to fight crime, and pasta theft has been on the backburner after more pressing issues such as organized crime were prioritized by local and regional governments.  

This police victory comes directly on the heels of a widely slammed court decision where another pasta thief was only sentenced to 12 years in prison for his heinous crime. The penne pickpocket gained a cult following on the internet, however, and critics posit that his notoriety secured his lenient sentence. Said one prosecutor, “We'll never know why he got go, but he sparked into an interweb glow.” 

The citizens of North America will have to wait and see the next developments in this thrilling tortellini tale.
