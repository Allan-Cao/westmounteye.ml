The Enlightenment of the 18th century is widely considered to be one of the most important time periods in human history. While technological progress during that time was of an unprecedented scale, a far greater advancement was in the values of freedom, democracy, and reason that were fostered during that period. Freedom and democracy in particular were the values claimed to have been upheld by capitalism and only by capitalism. However, despite capitalism adhering to the enlightenment values more than previous economic systems, according to the Marxist philosophy of dialectical materialism, it is only one step towards achieving these values.

To see why, we must first understand what capitalism is. Capitalism is a system where the means of production are privately owned. That is, a small handful of individuals control all of the trade and industry of the economy. The vast majority of people ultimately have no say in how the companies they work at are handled. Instead, they are relegated to being simply a cog in the machine of industry. You can choose your slave master by choosing to work at a different firm, but you will always be the slave of a firm. Capitalism is a system where the means of production are not democratically controlled, and where the vast majority of people are subject to immense control within their workplace. This means that capitalism ultimately does not adhere to the principles of the enlightenment. While this is not to say that capitalism was a less free or democratic economic system than systems preceding capitalism, it is undoubtedly the case that capitalism still contains within it a low degree of freedom for the vast majority of the population.

The next question would then be which system would be more free than capitalism? A free and democratic society is one which grants freedom and democracy to the masses instead of the few. By this definition, a system where workers control the means of production would be a more free and democratic system as opposed to one where a small handful of individuals control the means of production.

This system is called “socialism”. Socialism is not like how Bernie Sanders uses the term: a capitalist economy with social programs such as universal healthcare. Rather, socialism is an economic system by which workers control the means of production. There are many types of socialism, from state socialism, where the state plans the economy on behalf of the people; to market socialism, where there still exists a free market but firms are instead controlled by workers as opposed to owners; to the range of different forms of communism, where workers control the means of production and the system of currency and profit is abolished. In this article we will be arguing for market socialism, also known as economic democracy.

While it is true that socialism adheres to the values of the enlightenment to a better degree than capitalism does, it is important to note that even if a system is more free and democratic, that doesn’t mean that it is necessarily a better system. For example, if socialism was demonstrated to be an incredibly inefficient system which destroys the quality of life of the people under it, the democracy and freedom associated with socialism could be argued to not be enough to warrant implementation of socialism. Instead, this point suggests that socialism is a preferable system to capitalism if it achieves at least similar or better outcomes compared to capitalism. One could even argue that socialism would still be preferable to capitalism even if it created a slightly worse quality of life for its people, but we will demonstrate that this argument is not one that even needs to be entertained.

How does market socialism perform compared to capitalism? The data on market socialism primarily deals with firms in capitalist economies which function like firms that would exist in market socialist economies. These firms are known as “worker cooperatives” or “labor managed enterprises”, where workers vote on how the business functions.

There are four parts to this question. The first part is how worker cooperatives start up, which deals with what incentives are in place for worker cooperatives to start up as opposed to conventional firms. The second part is how worker cooperatives survive relative to conventional firms once they are up and running. The third part is how well are worker cooperatives able to expand relative to conventional firms. Finally, the fourth part is if there are any other benefits or drawbacks to worker cooperatives relative to conventional firms. It is important to note that we are not arguing that market socialism is inherently better than capitalism in all of its forms. Rather, if set up correctly it can perform comparatively to conventional firms or in some cases end up outperforming them.

#### Starting up Worker Cooperatives

It is well known that worker cooperatives are very rare relative to conventional firms within capitalist countries. There are a combination of reasons for this, some which have to do with factors outside of the worker cooperatives themselves and others have to do with the formation of worker cooperatives. Many people will assume that because there are few worker cooperatives relative to conventional firms that it must mean that the worker cooperatives necessarily perform worse, but that is not the case as we will explain in the following subsection. We will go through the main three issues with the formation of worker cooperatives, and explain how in a market socialist society they would be almost completely solved with the right regulations. While these regulations would necessarily be susceptible to the Marxian critiques of capitalism, which socialism intends to fix, we feel that these are necessary to ensure the proper functioning of a market socialist society. It is first important to note however that all three of these issues only affect the formation of worker cooperatives from scratch as opposed to the conversion of existing firms into worker cooperatives. Additionally, all three of these issues interact with each other and therefore cannot be separated from each other in a discussion on worker cooperatives.

The first concern is with the collective action problems associated with the formation of worker cooperatives. Creating a new cooperative is very expensive because of all the collective action involved, because there has to be collective agreements on how much money each individual will have to invest into the worker cooperative. Not only is this expensive, but it also creates perverse incentives where some individuals may want to free-ride by not investing any money into the business but still gain the profits that the business makes. 

This problem can be solved with a combination of two regulations put in place. The first would be that firms which first start up are allowed to be conventional firms, and then after a certain cutoff point they must be converted to worker cooperatives. Socially-motivated entrepreneurs are needed to initially start up worker cooperatives, even if that does sacrifice a very small portion of the democracy that would exist under a market socialist economy. The second would be to allow for workers who invest different amounts of money into the firm to get larger proportions of the profits accumulated. This would increase the incentive for individuals to invest in the firm, therefore increasing the size and profitability of the firm in the long run.

The second concern is with the lowered amount of self-interest that there would be in establishing a worker cooperative as opposed to establishing a conventional firm. Because the profits are shared more within a worker cooperative this reduces the financial incentive for someone to actually start a worker cooperative. We acknowledge that this incentive structure is a legitimate problem that can never be fully alleviated in a market socialist society. The policies discussed above in the first concern would go a way to alleviating this concern, but there will still be a slightly lower incentive which will have a negative effect on the startup rate of worker cooperatives compared to conventional firms.

The third concern is finance. Individuals who want to start up worker cooperatives generally don’t have the financial resources to start worker cooperatives. This is due to the fact that banks will discriminate against worker cooperatives. However, in the case of the Mondragon set of worker cooperatives, there existed a cooperative bank which solved the finance problem. This collection of worker cooperatives were extremely successful and this suggests that the finance issues can be fairly easily solved. Additionally, the policies discussed in the first concern would help solve the finance problem.

Overall, economic theory suggests that worker cooperatives do suffer disadvantages compared to conventional firms with regards to their creation. However, this can be mostly alleviated through simple policy changes. While these may slightly reduce the democratic aspect of some firms within a market socialist society, they can go a long way to making the disadvantages of worker cooperatives in terms of their startup rate minimal relative to conventional firms.

#### Performance of Existing Worker Cooperatives

While there are many metrics one can use to measure the performance of worker cooperatives relative to conventional firms, the metric which best captures the comparative performance of each firm and encompasses many statistics within it is the survival rate. Studies that look into the survival rate of worker cooperatives relative to conventional firms consistently find that worker cooperatives have better short-term survival rates as opposed to conventional firms, with as good as, if not better long-term survival rates compared to conventional firms, although more research is needed to properly examine the comparative long-term survival rates.

There are several qualitative and quantitative reasons for this difference. Firstly, studies have shown that worker cooperatives are more productive than conventional firms, which would translate into a survival advantage. Secondly, worker cooperatives respond to changes in the economic environment in different ways than conventional firms do which could translate into a competitive advantage. Worker cooperatives tend to adjust wages, while conventional firms adjust hours. Lastly, cooperative members tend to have much higher enthusiasm and commitment to their workplace, which provides an initial psychological resource which results in worker cooperatives being less likely to close down compared with conventional firms when faced with the same information. All of these factors mean that worker cooperatives perform better than conventional firms once they are up and running.

#### Expansion of Worker Cooperatives

There are collective action problems that exist within worker cooperatives when it comes to expansion. However, there is a real-world example of a worker cooperative circumnavigating this problem. The Spanish cooperative group Mondragon solves this problem by subdividing cooperatives into separate organizations when they get too large, in addition to creating groups of interconnected cooperatives that subdivide production processes and enter into income sharing agreements. What was once a single enterprise employing 24 workers in 1956 had grown to more than 100 cooperatives employing 24,875 workers in 1994. All of this was achieved without sacrificing its economic performance. In the 1970s, labor productivity, total factor productivity, worker earnings and growth were greater in the Mondragon cooperatives than in any comparable business in the Spanish economy. Overall, this suggests that while there are problems when it comes to the expansion of cooperatives, this is easily overcome through the division of labor.

#### Other Effects of Worker Cooperatives

There are a few other benefits that worker cooperatives have over conventional firms, ignoring the higher degree of freedom and democracy that cooperatives have. The first benefit is the reduction in exploitation of the workers, which is not a point we will be arguing in this article. The second benefit is a reduction in the alienation of workers within the worker cooperative model of organization. This increases socialization and decreases the costs of supervision within a firm, as this creates subtle peer pressure within the firm. This is an important benefit to note because it deals with how the workers - the majority of the population - are affected by working within worker cooperatives relative to conventional firms.

#### Conclusion

How do we determine which system is more moral? The consequentialist framework of morality would suggest that the most moral system is that which achieves the best consequences for an individual or society relative to a particular goal. What should that goal be? We would argue that this goal should be, broadly speaking, maximizing the happiness of society. This means, among other things, increasing the degree of freedom and economic growth that society has, and we have presented evidence that market socialism achieves more freedom and more economic growth than capitalism does.

We can compare this with democracy in government, a feature common to nearly all western countries. Democracy in government gives citizens a similar degree of freedom compared to economic democracy in that you have a certain degree of authority over how everything around you is run. Both affect you in different ways, but they’re both very influential, so economic democracy grants people a similar degree of freedom that democracy in government does. Empirical studies which have looked at how democracy in government affects economic growth have found between a weak negative effect to a strong positive effect, with causality difficult to determine, as opposed to economic democracy which is shown to have positive economic effects. Both economic democracy and democracy in government produce similar degrees of freedom for people, while only economic democracy has been shown to produce positive economic effects. Economic democracy is simply an expansion of the enlightenment principles that democracy in government upheld in addition to creating a greater amount of economic growth.

In short, market socialism not only adheres to the enlightenment principles which capitalism claimed to uphold, but goes further in that it ends up maximizing the quality of life of the people to a greater extent than democracy in government, a feature common in western societies does. This suggests that while democracy in government is good, and should be upheld, a society with economic democracy but no democracy in government is preferable to one where there is democracy in government but no economic democracy.

We do not believe in socialism because we hate Jeff Bezos, but because we care for the thousands of workers below him. The vast majority of us Generation Zs are going to be working within firms in the future, and it is up to us to decide if we want to work for authoritarian firms where we have no autonomy over our workplaces, or democratic firms where we have a greater degree of freedom and autonomy compared to generations before us. Whichever one happens in the future will be up to us to decide.
