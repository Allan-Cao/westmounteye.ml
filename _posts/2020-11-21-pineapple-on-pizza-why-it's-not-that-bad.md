For all you Pizza Purists, get this through your head: PINEAPPLE CAN ACTUALLY BE GOOD ON PIZZA.  The main argument against pineapple is a) that it is acidic and b) that its sweetness takes away from the actual flavour of pizza. You also have famous chefs, like Gordon Ramsay,  backing this idea that pineapple is horrendous on pizza. Now, you may think that this automatically makes pineapple on pizza a sin. However, science disagrees with you. 

Writer Barb Stuckey says, “We like sweet because it signals calories, or energy, to us. And we like salt because we need it for normal bodily functions. We have no sodium storage system, as we do with other minerals (i.e. we store calcium in our bones), so Mother Nature's solution is a built-in craving for it. The combination of these two positive biological responses is VERY pleasurable. To use an analogy, it's akin to hearing beautiful music while sniffing rose petals: two positive sensory stimuli.” 

This combination of sweet and savoury present on a pineapple pizza is clearly far superior to pizza without a mix of these flavours. Other than its taste, pineapple on pizza is also nutritious, containing Vitamin B, Vitamin C, and manganese. The only valid argument against pineapple on pizza is the presence of the enzyme Bromelain. Pineapples are the only natural source of Bromelain, which digests protein. That is why when you eat pineapple, you feel a tingling sensation on your tongue and the roof of your mouth. 

However, like any other enzyme, Bromelain denatures when exposed to heat. This is why I would say YES to a pineapple pizza where the pineapples are cooked along with the pizza and NEVER to a pizza where fresh pineapple is added after. The heat of an oven also allows for a more subtle sweet flavour to emerge from the pineapple, which is far less extreme than fresh pineapple. 

While many hate pineapple on pizza, it is probably because of one bad experience. If so, I encourage you to try it again. If you are adamant about your decision, that is fine with me, as food is subjective, but be warned: I will never look at you the same.
