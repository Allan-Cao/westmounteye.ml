For as long as the American people can remember, the concession speech has been a staple of American politics. Take, for example, the 2000 Presidential Election, which pitted Republican nominee George W. Bush against Democrat Al Gore. By the end of election night, the final state that had been left uncalled was the swing state of Florida, which both candidates needed to gain the presidency. It was only after an onslaught of civil turmoil and vote recounts, when it was finalized that Bush beat Gore by just 537 votes in the state. Despite this razor-thin margin, by the finalization of the results on December 13, Gore still delivered a concession speech, congratulating Bush on his astounding victory. Throughout American history, conceding has always remained the status quo in the political world. However, as we have seen over the past four years, Donald Trump has not been renowned as a president with the most respect for tradition. When it came to this year’s election, people were bracing themselves for the worse. In the constitution, no amendment explicitly states the president has to personally concede. Whether the president leaves on his own accord or is thrown out of the White House on Inauguration Day, all that needs to occur is the transfer of power between the two tickets.

Donald Trump has been quite bombastic when it comes to his claims regarding the election. After the Associated Press called the election, Trump went on a Tweetstorm, falsely claiming that “Tens of thousands of votes were illegally received after 8 P.M. on Tuesday, Election Day”. This divisive conflict has left Americans more polarised than ever, with many expressing concern over the long term implications Trump’s electoral outcry will leave on the nation. Recently, he has been collecting donations from his supporters in order to fund upcoming rallies and protests over his claims that widespread voter fraud has tipped the results in Biden’s favour. In an address, Trump states, “If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us.” Recently, a pro-Trump rally in Pheonix, AZ, saw over 500 people gather by the polling stations, lobbying for change. During the demonstration, armed Trump supporters waved MAGA flags outside the Maricopa County Elections Department. These protesters are taking Trump’s claims to heart, chanting “back the blue” and “four more years”.  Adel Belgaied, a political activist and spokesperson, gave a speech to the furious crowd. “Lord, a lot of us are confused why dead people’s ballots were received, why it takes 600,000 votes four days to be counted – and they’re still not finished,” Although these assertions may seem like baseless conjecture, it begs the question: how legitimate are Trump’s claims? Does his endeavour to pursue the election to the very end have any chance of success? 

From what has been provided so far, it seems highly unlikely that the Trump Campaign’s lawsuits will warrant any significant response from the nation’s courts. Numerous Republican senators and Congress members have urged the Supreme Court to freeze the ballot count (to no avail). Trump has also launched a barrage of lawsuits in swing states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Arizona, with varying levels of success. Aside from the Trump Administration’s claims that “illegal ballots” are disenfranchising millions of Americans, he has also publicly sought recounts in some of the most contested states. Depending on the constituency, laws pertaining to recounts can vary wildly. In Wisconsin, a candidate is allowed to call for a recount if the margin is less than 1%. In Georgia, a recount may be called if it’s less than 0.5% of the ballots cast. Despite these minuscule margins, a recount likely is not going to alter the outcome of the race on a large scale. To reverse the margins on Biden’s lead, Trump would need to somehow persuade the judges that the majority of ballots cast in these areas were cast illegally. Mail-in votes are always tracked with a close eye by election officials, which makes any form of fraud difficult to perform. So far, the Trump Campaign’s attempts to nullify the results and freeze the ballot counting has not been particularly fruitful. His lawsuits have also failed to provide any conclusive evidence that can definitively prove widespread fraudulent activity. Thus far, no judges have been swayed by these assertions, with numerous officials jokingly referring to the situation as “SharpieGate.” Furthermore, Donald Trump has made numerous claims that he’s seeking to pursue the case up to the Supreme Court. Although the court is mostly comprised of Republicans, the justices likely won’t tamper with the results. Currently, the Trump Campaign has taken to the Supreme Court the issue of whether or not the Pennsylvanian ballots that were tabulated on Election Day should be counted. However, even if those votes do get thrown out,  it’s unlikely that it would dramatically swing the results to Trump’s favour.

Over the past few weeks, the United States’ future has been looking more uncertain than ever. With mail-in ballots seemingly nullifying Trump’s lead overnight, there is a growing cause for concern. The American people have never been more divided, and an abundance of world leaders are anxiously watching the dust settle. As of now, the outcomes of the Trump Administration’s efforts are uncertain. Both Democrats and Republicans alike are fighting for change, and people are swiftly taking sides. Regardless of which party that comes out on top, the 2020 Presidential Election will forever be known as one of the most pivotal moments in American history.
