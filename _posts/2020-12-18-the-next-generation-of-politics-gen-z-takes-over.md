Is Gen Z taking over politics? A recent survey found more than half of the kids consulted had developed a heightened interest in politics over the last several months. From this, it can be inferred that this may be influenced by the global lockdowns, augmented by the advent of social media. In quarantine, kids and teens had nowhere to go but their electronics. Eventually, they ran out of content they would usually consume and started stumbling into the realm of social media politics. Simultaneously, the immediate threat and mismanagement of the coronavirus sparked them to question the people who influence such a large part of their daily life, leading to many youth deeming politics a necessity, rather than merely an interest.

Politics has historically been a game for the older generations, with children generally uninvolved, even when the topic at hand would cause great impact on the younger generations. However, with an international pandemic, youth seem to be feeling the effects of political policy more profoundly. If the people in charge don’t prevent the pandemic from getting out of hand, then the world as we know it could continue to be riddled with continuing social symptoms from the virus. The world’s future lays in the hands of people that youth know may not be trustworthy. The fact that these individuals may not have their best intention in mind likely scares the children of our country.

The specific survey that was conducted polled a demographic of children who likely use social media, and found that the more a child used social media, the more likely it was that they were involved in politics. It is clear that social media affects political activism in the youth demographic. As the use of social media increased, so did the amount of youth who sought out political information. Through social media, activists seek to inform and get youth more interested in their future and how politics affects them. Once they are informed, youth will often continue to seek out knowledge on their own.

In the days of COVID-19, the BLM protests, elections, corruption and influence, politics has head-butted itself into the lives of our youth. Society as a whole now must inform and show youth how to be politically responsible. They will soon be our future, and we must ensure the future in in safe hands.
