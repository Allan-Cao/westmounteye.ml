## A Letter From The Editor (In-Chief)

![](letters-to-the-editor.jpg)

2020 will be remembered, years from now, for many things. It will certainly be the year of the pandemic, the year of the 24-hour news cycle, the year of online everything, the year of DoorDashing a $5 burrito for $25, perhaps the year where everything started going wrong, or, hopefully, the last year that humanity spends in its foolish teenage years. And for many of you, this will the the last year of your foolish teenage years, in spirit if not in number. We as a community of individuals have matured much over the past 12 months, through the suffering of many hardships and much strife. And I must applaud all of you, for toughing it out in this truly strange and difficult year. This year has been the end of an era, and perhaps the start of a new one.

As I write this, schooling for the majority of us is occurring online. Obviously, this has been a difficult experience for many of us. However, it also seems to be the direction of the future, if not for learning, at least for many other facets of life. From online shopping to Zoom calls, the future certainly seems to be online. This brings both positives and negatives, too numerous to state right now, but to be sure, this is a paradigm change in the way in which our society works. Of course, I’m sure there will be a correction towards in-person activities, given how much we have missed them during quarantine, but one has to wonder if this re-appreciation for this physical will last…

Politics this year has been interesting to say the least. It’s fitting that this is the year where we all learn what doomscrolling is (mindlessly going through social media consuming negative content, often political). From controversy to controversy, many around governmental management of the pandemic, it seems as if there’s always something new to worry about. And of course, the markets seem to many to be completely disconnected from the concerns of the populace. However, there seems to be a wave of motivation around the globe by the common individual to speak up about whatever issue they feel powerfully about. And youth seem even more involved than ever before. 

Video games, video games, video games. Where would we be without them over quarantine? Movie studios stubbornly refused to release anything new for the better part of half a year, and despite years of progress on the e-book front, the medium is still too decentralized for any but the most avid readers to dig through. As a result, many of us turned to video games as our medium of entertainment, even for those who a year ago, would never have considered themselves “gamers”. The “gaming” community too, grew massively. Sites like Twitch and Discord have exploded in popularity, and have expanded the communities from merely video games to many other hobbies, and in some cases more serious affairs. See, for example: live-streamed funerals and Discord classes.

I hope that you have come out of this year, if battered, at least alive and able to fight another day. And this is to hoping that next year is better, if only because we’ve learned much from the year that has just passed. From your editor-in-chief, this is Happy Holidays and a wish for a better 2021.
